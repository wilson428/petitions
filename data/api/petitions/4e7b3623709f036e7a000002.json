  "body": "The proposed Keystone XL pipeline threatens our water, our land, and our future. If permitted and constructed, the pipeline would further fuel the devastating extraction of tar sands in Alberta, and funnel highly toxic tar sands oil across the U.S.\r\n\r\nBig Oil has exploited the Canadian tar sands to great profit, but the environment and indigenous communities have paid a steep price.\r\n\r\nThe threat that pipeline spills pose to our land and water supplies is simply unacceptable. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, tar sands oil produces three times as much carbon pollution as conventional oil. We have a moral obligation to prevent the expansion of the tar sands and move towards a 100% clean energy future.\r\n\r\nPlease reject the Keystone XL permit and invest in real solutions to our climate and energy crisis.",
