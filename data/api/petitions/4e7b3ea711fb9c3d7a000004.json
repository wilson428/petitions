  "body": "Only 6 states, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont, plus the District of Columbia, currently legally allow same-sex couples to get married and have the same benefits as heterosexual couples.  And also, though these 6 states, plus D.C., allow same-sex marriage, federally, they are not recognized at all, whatsoever.  The LGBT community is the last group of people to not get  full rights in our nation, the great nation of freedom and opportunity.  We the people need to call on President Barack Obama to take a stand as our country's leader, and fully legalize same-sex marriage across the whole nation.",
