  "body": "There is an overwhelming lack of evidence that marijuana is a dangerous drug that should be classified with heroin or cocaine. Hundreds of thousands of otherwise peaceful, law abiding citizens are arrested each year for simple possession, at enormous cost to our society. Our prisons are too crowded, we need the money, and the regulated sale of marijuana would be safer for everybody. Americans would rather deal with shopkeepers than drug dealers when buying the marijuana they will consume regardless of its legal status. Prohibition failed in the '20s, and is failing us now.",
