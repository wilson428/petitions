  "body": "10th Circuit Court of Appeals: \"\u2026Much of the government\u2019s behavior... and its prosecution of Leonard Peltier is to be condemned. The government withheld evidence. It intimidated witnesses. These facts are not disputed.\"  \r\n\r\nWhile others were acquitted on grounds of self defense, Peltier was convicted in connection with the 1975 shooting deaths of two FBI agents.  Evidence shows that prosecutors knowingly presented false statements to a Canadian court to extradite Peltier and manufactured the murder weapon (the gun and shell casings entered into evidence didn't match; this fact was hidden from the jury). The number of constitutional violations in this case is simply staggering.\r\n\r\nIt's time to right this wrong. Mr. President, you can and must free Leonard Peltier.",
