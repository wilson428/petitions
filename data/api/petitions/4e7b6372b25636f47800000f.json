  "body": "We, the undersigned, hereby declare that anti-terrorism legislation passed by our US Congress since the tragic September 11, 2001 attacks on our nation, seriously damage and infringe upon the constitutional protections that are enshrined in our Bill of Rights.\r\n\r\nWe declare that it is not patriotic, but rather Un-American to destroy the very freedoms which cause Americans to love their country. We oppose the \u201csneak and peek\u201d provision of the PATRIOT Act, which infringes our 4th amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure by denying citizens their right to be aware that their property is to be searched and their right to protest such search. We oppose the PATRIOT Act\u2019s destruction of e-mail and Internet privacy. \r\n\r\n\"Those who sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither\"",
