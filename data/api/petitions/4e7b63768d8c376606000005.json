  "body": "The \u201cwar on drugs\u201d has yielded predictable suffering and waste, as the prohibition of widely desired substances has never generated positive results - except for the cartels and gangs who control the illegal market. Marijuana prohibition in particular is a colossal waste of resources that could be put to better use. Taking a noncriminal, regulatory approach to marijuana would enable states to pass their own laws, regulations and taxes to control marijuana and would end the Justice Department's intimidation tactics in medical marijuana states. One or more states will likely legalize adult use of marijuana in 2012, and the Obama administration should stop wasting scarce federal resources and uphold the president\u2019s campaign pledge to respect states\u2019 rights when it comes to marijuana.",
