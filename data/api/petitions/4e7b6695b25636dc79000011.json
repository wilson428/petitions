It is not the U.S. people who are excessively criminal.  It is overzealous policy that destroys the future of America's youth at great expense to the taxpayer.\r\n\r\nWhere would you be, Mr. President, had you been convicted and imprisoned because of your admitted Marijuana usage?  What great future leaders, thinkers and innovators are being destroyed today because of this useless policy?\r\n\r\nDrug use is a social issue, and should be addressed by health care professionals, not the prison system.",
