  "body": "Disclosure Petition - Paradigm Research Group\r\n\"We, the undersigned, strongly urge the President of the United States to formally acknowledge an extraterrestrial presence engaging the human race and immediately release into the public domain all files from all agencies and military services relevant to this phenomenon.\"\r\n___\r\nHundreds of military and government agency witnesses have come forward with testimony confirming this extraterrestrial presence.   Opinion polls now indicate more than 50% of the American people believe there is an extraterrestrial presence and more than 80% believe the government is not telling the truth about this phenomenon.  The people have a right to know. The people can handle the truth.\r\nRelevant Websites: www.disclosurepetition.info,  www.paradigmresearchgroup.org",
