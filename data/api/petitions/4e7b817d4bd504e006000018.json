  "body": "Lost opportunities for farmers and businesses have real consequences. With over $419 million in estimated U.S. retail sales, American companies making hemp products have no choice but to import their raw materials because American farmers continue to fear they will be prosecuted due to an outdated federal policy which confuses non-drug industrial hemp with drug varieties of Cannabis.\r\n\r\nSustainable hemp seed, fiber and oil are already used in nutritious food, textiles, body care and even auto-parts. Many American companies are using imported hemp in their products today.\r\n\r\nWe urge you to allow U.S. farmers to follow in the footsteps of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, all who were hemp farmers, and once again grow this sustainable and profitable non-drug crop.",
