  "body": "The GAO report \"HORSE WELFARE: Action Needed to Address Unintended Consequences from Cessation of Domestic Slaughter\" documents the decline in horse welfare, & the economic demise of the horse industry due to inappropriate federal intervention that closed the humane & regulated horse slaughter plants in the U.S. As pointed out by the GAO, & as testified to by practically every horse industry & Ag organization in the Nation, appropriation riders & bills that seek to eliminate any possibility of humanely processing horses offer zero solutions & only exacerbate the suffering of horses, increase the number of needless & wasteful deaths, cause more abandonment, neglect, pain, & misery--they deprive families of livelihoods & the ability to raise their kids with the joy of horses in their lives.",
