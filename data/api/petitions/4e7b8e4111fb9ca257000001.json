  "body": "We believe that it would be in our economy's best interest to form a new coinage standard. This standard would consist of three coins. a ten-cent coin, a fifty-cent coin, and a one dollar coin. This standard would open up new efficiencies in both everyday economic life, and in government spending.\r\n\r\nAccording to the US Mint, in 2010 a single one-cent coin cost 1.79 cents to produce and distribute. Minting 3,487 million pennies in 2010 cost the US taxpayer $27.5 million in order to subsidize the existence of the penny.\r\n\r\nThere is a similar situation with nickels. A single five-cent coin cost 9.16 cents to produce and distribute in 2010.\r\n\r\nWe waste valuable time handling coins that aren't worth much. Getting rid of these coins could save us up to $1 billion annually in lost opportunity costs.",
