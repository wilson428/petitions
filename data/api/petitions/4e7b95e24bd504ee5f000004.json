  "body": "The Defense of Marriage Act bypasses the Constitution in making it so states do not need to recognize other state's marriages if those marriages are not between a man and a woman. This results in confusing legal issues when a gay couple moves from one state to another, as well as creating a definition of marriage that is bigoted against homosexual couples.",
