  "body": "Appropriate regulation of online poker will put the U.S. in charge of safeguarding responsible adult players, prevent underage participation and protect those with excessive gaming habits. The current, unregulated U.S. marketplace does not guarantee a single consumer protection.  \r\n\r\nU.S. regulation of this global industry will also mean the creation of American jobs and billions in new revenue without raising taxes.  Licensed U.S.-based horse race wagering sites have proven that online betting sites can be successfully regulated. It is time to allow online poker the same opportunity.\r\n",
