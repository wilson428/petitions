  "body": "This month Palestine will apply to become a UN member. We call upon you not to veto this application in the Security Council. \r\n\r\nFor decades Palestinians have been prevented from exercising their rights to freedom & self-determination on even a portion of their historic homeland due to Israel\u2019s policies of ethnic cleansing, apartheid, military occupation & colonization. \r\n\r\nPalestinians are seeking UN membership as a way toward establishing a just & lasting peace that must include ending Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem & the Gaza Strip; equality for Palestinian citizens of Israel; & implementation of Palestinian refugees' right of return.\r\n\r\nPalestinians have waited 63 years for their human rights-Don't set a timetable for their freedom by vetoing their UN  membership bid.",
