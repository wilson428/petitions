  "body": "If any case in our lifetime cries out for prosecution by the Federal Government it is this one.\r\nIt is imperative to restore our faith in the justice system and our government as a whole.\r\n The federal interest in this case is that a conviction will ensure the safety of the children of our nation. It will show people that seek to harm children that you cannot murder a child, remain quiet and lie to government officials and suffer no consequences. \r\nShow us the Federal Government is serious about enforcing laws designed to more adequately and sufficiently protect our country's children. Povide proof that the Eric Holder's statement was true when he stated \r\n\u201cWe are signaling that, when it comes to keeping our children from harm, a new era of collaboration has begun\" \r\nSincerely,\r\nWe The People",
