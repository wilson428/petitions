  "body": "Citizens United dramatically altered the political dynamic of our country. Never before have corporations had so much sway over our country's politics, and as a result our nation looks less and less like a democracy every day. By calling corporations \"people\" and deeming money to be \"free speech,\" we are allowing the richest Americans to influence politics in a way that the vast majority of us can never dream of. By ending corporate personhood we can restore our country's democratic vision and create an America that answers to people rather than to money.\r\n\r\nStop the top 1% of Americans from drowning out the voices of the 99%. End corporate personhood and stop giving an unfair advantage to the wealthy few before it's too late.",
