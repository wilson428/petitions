  "body": "Legal employment-based immigration petitioners are defined as not being competing with American citizens for job opportunities by a very strict USCIS process including the prevailing wage test, the 2-month recruiting test, etc.\r\n\r\nThey fill in positions that either American citizens choose not to fill or there're not sufficient American citizens to fill up these positions.\r\n\r\nWithout EB immigrants, these jobs could have been permanently outsourced overseas, together with those closely-related jobs.  \r\n\r\nIt's a paradox that they de facto make many jobs stay inside U.S.  Moreover, they possess the experience and skills that help U.S. companies to be globally competitive.  \r\n\r\nThey should NOT be heavily backlogged for abiding by U.S. laws, while sympathy is given only to undocumented immigrants.",
