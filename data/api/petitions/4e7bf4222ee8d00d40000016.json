  "body": "Employment-based (EB) immigration visa quotas are distributed by countries regardless of the size of each country. As a result, EB2/EB3 Chinese and Indian petitioners are woefully backlogged.\r\n\r\nThey spend their best years using their experience & skills to help U.S. companies become more competitive globally. Without them, many jobs plus related jobs could have been permanently outsourced overseas.\r\n\r\nWith I-140 approved, had they been born in another country, they'd receive the greencard in a few months.\r\nEven a visa is not immediately available, they should still be eligible to apply for EAD & Advance Parole (AP), and to file I-485.\r\n\r\nNo law prohibits USCIS from accepting I-485 petition by a beneficiary with I-140 approved, though the petition will be pending until a visa number is available.",
