  "body": "Currently, churches usually receive tax exemptions based of off their specific religion and sect. If a specific sect is not already recognized, they are able to apply to become a recognized religion. This process gives the government the authority to determine which religions should and should not be recognized as 'true' religions in our country, a clear violation of the first amendment.",
