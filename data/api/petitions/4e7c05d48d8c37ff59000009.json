  "body": "We the People of the United States of America \r\nDemand an Amendment to the United States Constitution to End Prohibition of Marijuana, Marihuana, Hemp and Cannabis because we have a Right to Equal Protection Under the Law to NOT be prosecuted and punished for for growing, harvesting, farming, using, smoking, selling, manufacturing, brewing and bottling substances and products which are equally as dangerous or LESS dangerous than other legal products and substances such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, as used and sold to adults age 21 and over.  The government has entrapped Americans by concealing criminal penalties under Title 21 USC rather than listing them under Title 18 Crimes.  Also, the government spells marijuana and marihuana two ways in the law to conceal penalties.",
