  "body": "Mr.Obama, this is a petition for you to publicly recognize, whether in a live speech, or in one of your weekly youtube addresses, the #occupywallstreet movement that is currently taking place in NYC.\r\n\r\nThese men and women are trying to send a message to their fellow Americans and to the world- the big banks and the super-rich, who is \"buying out congress\", are the primary drivers of the ongoing recession.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, they are largely being ignored by the media in the United States due to the \"small size\" of the protests. Note that \"small size\" has not deterred Fox, CNN and other US news channels/newspapers from covering, and even putting on the front page, Tea Party and other far right protests, some of which have had as little as 100 people (#occupywallst varies from 500-3000)",
