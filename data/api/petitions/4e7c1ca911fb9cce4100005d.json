  "body": "The patent office's original interpretation of software as language and therefor patentable is much closer to reality and more productive for innovation than it's current practice of issuing software patents with no understanding of the patents being issued. \r\n\r\nUnder the patent office's current activity, patents have been come a way to stifle innovation and prevent competition rather than supporting innovation and competitive markets.  They've become a tool of antitrust employed by large companies against small ones. \r\n\r\nTo return sanity to the software industry - one of the few industries still going strong in America - direct the patent office to cease issuing software patents and to void all previously issued software patents.",
