  "body": "Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Americans experience unnecessary and inhumane discrimination every day. Whether it's the risk of being deported because our marriages aren't recognized by the federal government, denied a job or fired from a job simply for who we are, bullied to death in schools, refused full parenting rights, or denied adequate and appropriate health care/coverage, LGBT Americans do not have access to the same civil rights as non-LGBT Americans.\r\n\r\nOur country is better than this, and we ask the Obama Administration to take any and all steps necessary in order to make LGBT Americans fully equal in all matters governed by federal civil law in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories.\r\n\r\nThis petition is supported by GetEQUAL (www.getequal.org)",
