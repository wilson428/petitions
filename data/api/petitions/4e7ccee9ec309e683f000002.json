  "body": "Since 2001, the National Guard has answered the call both domestically & overseas. The last 10 years of war as well as disasters such as Hurricane Katrina have demonstrated to our country that the National Guard is an indispensable member of our national defense and disaster response forces. Like other military forces, the Guard has been challenged by long-term & multiple deployments to front lines in Iraq & Afghanistan, yet they are not currently represented in the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). Becoming a permanent member of the JCS will further enhance the ability of the National Guard to perform both its state and federal missions by ensuring that the Chief of the National Guard Bureau is at the table when important homeland defense and disaster response issues are being addressed.",
