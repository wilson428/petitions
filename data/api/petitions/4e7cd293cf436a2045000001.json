  "body": "Marijuana prohibition as a policy has failed. We have taken a substance less harmful than alcohol and, through prohibition, have allowed its production and sale to generate massive profits for drug cartels and other criminal actors. Voters and legislators in states across the country are taking steps to reform marijuana laws for both medical and non-medical use so that they serve the best interests of their citizens. These are thoughtful, rational and beneficial reforms.\r\n\r\nDo you, as president, trust the people and leaders in the individual states to enact their own marijuana laws or do you feel the federal government should impose prohibition on all 50 states?",
