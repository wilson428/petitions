  "body": "Fluoridation violates the individual's right to informed consent.\r\n\r\nFluoride is not a nutrient. Its sole benefit is topical. Swallowing it can cause harm. 41% of American children, aged 12-15, have dental fluorosis, indicating over-exposure. Minorities are disproportionally harmed (CDC, 2005, 2010).\r\n\r\nAn unrefuted study indicates fluoride is a risk factor for bone cancer in boys (Bassin, 2006). There is mounting evidence that fluoride is an endocrine disruptor, lowers IQ, and accumulates in bone, increasing joint pain and the risk of fractures (NRC, 2006).\r\n\r\nVulnerable subgroups include bottle-fed infants, the elderly, those with kidney disease, diabetics, and minorities (NRC, 2006).\r\n\r\nThe chemicals used are contaminated industrial by-products and never approved by the FDA.\r\n(FluorideAlert.org)",
