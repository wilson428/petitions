  "body": "Genetically modified foods are a recent technology and are already in many commercial foods Americans consume today. While they may have benefits, these genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have not been studied rigorously enough in their potential human health impacts. Therefore, it should be the consumer's right to know whether the food they choose to purchase contains all or partly genetically modified organisms as ingredients. \r\n\r\nAlthough certified Organic foods are labeled as such and contain no GMOs, the consumer does not know whether they are buying genetically modified foods when they can't or choose not to buy Organic. \r\n\r\nPetition to require food companies to label their foods according to their contents in terms of containing genetically modified organisms.
