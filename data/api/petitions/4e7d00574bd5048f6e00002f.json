  "body": "Give the people the freedom to choose whether drinking raw milk products is right for them by enabling the legalized sale and distribution of raw milk products across all states.\r\n\r\nThere are substantial health benefits from raw milk that are not available in pasteurized milk products.\r\n\r\nMany of the nutritional, anti-microbial and immune-enhancing components of raw milk are greatly reduced in effectiveness by pasteurization, and completely destroyed by ultra-pasteurization. \r\n\r\nThe risks associated with drinking raw milk are greatly exaggerated. Compared to raw milk there are 515 times more illnesses from L-mono due to deli meats and 29 times more illness from L-mono due to pasteurized milk.\r\n\r\nThe Westin A. Price Foundation has more information at: \r\nhttp://www.realmilk.com/rawmilkoverview.html",
