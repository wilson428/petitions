  "body": "President Obama should support the American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act of 2011, S.B. 1176/H.R. 2966, to ban the slaughter of horses for human consumption:\r\n \r\n1) Horses are revered for their contributions to the building of this country, their companionship and special bond with people;\r\n(2) Horses are not raised for the purpose of being slaughtered for human consumption, and, indeed, American horses are not raised, fed and medicated within the FDA guidelines established for food animals, making them potentially unfit and unsafe for human consumption;\r\n(3) Horse slaughter is animal cruelty, not humane euthanasia; it means environmental and economic devastation for communities; and\r\n(4) Banning slaughter would reduce the number of horses in need and improve horse welfare.   \r\n ",
