  "body": "Every federal election should be a national holiday to increase voter turnout. The 2008 Presidential election holds the record for voter turnout with 63% of eligible voters voting. However good it is that 63% of voters voted, 37% did not express their opinions that day. Imagine if the record score for a math test was 63%. 37% is 78 million people, meaning 78 million people did not vote. Maybe they did not want to, or maybe they were delayed. To make every election day a national holiday (Election Day) would increase voter turnout not only by making that day a reminder to the people of their civic duty, but by giving them the time to vote. To increase voter turnout is to help show the true beliefs and opinions of the people of this great nation, and not just the beliefs and opinions of 63%.",
