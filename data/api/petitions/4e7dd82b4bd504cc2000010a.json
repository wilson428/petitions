  "body": "Citizens for Recycling First believes the best solution for coal ash disposal problems is to quit throwing coal ash away.  Millions of tons of coal ash are safely recycled every year into construction materials like concrete and wallboard -- conserving natural resources, reducing landfill use and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions.\r\n\r\nThat environmentally beneficial practice is threatened by irresponsibly labeling coal ash as \"toxic\" or \u201chazardous.\u201d EPA is considering disposal regulations that may include a \"hazardous\" designation. Regulatory uncertainty created by this proposal is already harming recycling. It is imperative that the Administration lift the cloud of uncertainty by promptly creating new disposal regulations without an unwarranted \"hazardous\" label.\r\n\r\nwww.recyclingfirst.org",
