  "body": "Evolution has been unquestionably supported by scientific evidence, and is universally accepted in the scientific community,  While it may run contrary to personally held religious beliefs, it is not the purpose of our publicly funded education system to teach religious dogma as fact, or even controversy, in a biology class.  \r\n\r\nIt makes as much sense to teach creationism in a science class as it would to teach that the sun rotates around the earth in an astronomy class, or that lightning and storms are created by the the gods in a weather science lecture.\r\n\r\nEvolutionary theory is the basis for much of modern biology, and to accept creationism is to reject modern knowledge of geology, carbon dating, genetics, and history.  Depriving or confusing students about Evolution is unacceptable.",
