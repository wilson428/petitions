  "body": "Modern research has proven what disabled Veterans have known for a very long time, Cannabis is an effective medicine. Veterans from the time of the United States Revolution through World War I had legal access to cannabis but in 1942 due to the efforts of a handful of powerful men cannabis was removed from the United States Formulary. Modern science has shown us that the human body makes it's own cannabis like substances called cannabinoids and that these cannabinoids are shown to be involved in various functions throughout the body like pain and anxiety. Marijuana works with this natural body system to ease the symptoms of PTSD giving disabled Veterans a big improvement in their quality of life. We owe our disabled Veterans our freedom, the least we should do is treat their pain and PTSD.",
