  "body": "Many talented H-1B beneficiaries choose not to stay in the U.S. because their H-4 spouses cannot work.

This would be a quick and easy way to ameliorate the severe hardship experienced by H-1B families.\r\n\r\nThrough administrative re-interpretation, USCIS could allow the spouses to obtain extensions of H-1B status, so they can past the normal six-year limit without having their own labor certification. Under this interpretation, the H-1B husband who does not have his own labor certification can still use his wife\u2019s labor certification on a derivative basis to file for an H-1B extension. ",
