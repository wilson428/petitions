  "body": "Children's cancer is the #1 cause of death in children, yet the funding approved by Congress for Childhood Cancer is supremely low when compared to Breast Cancer Research which is the 6th leading cause of death in women.  It is not okay that our children are dying because government funding is lacking.  Cancer is the leading cause of death in children over all other childhood diseases combined!  Children's Cancer Research needs to be at the forefront of funding.  These children are our future and need to be taken care, stood up for, and protected, and this includes making them a priority in government funding for cancer prevention research.  CHILDREN ARE DYING EVERY SINGLE DAY DUE TO CANCER.  IT IS TIME FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO STEP UP AND PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING FOR CHILDREN'S CANCER.",
