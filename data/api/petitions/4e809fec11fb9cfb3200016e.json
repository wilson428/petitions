  "body": "US Embassy and Consulates in mainland China employ a third-party call center to schedule visa interviews, which incurs a fee of $0.7/minute and extensive traveling cost for buying pre-paid phone cards. This system does not benefit the US government and nourishes corruption.\r\n\r\nWe the people urge the U.S. Embassy and Consulates to switch to a free online system for visa-scheduling in China. If not, please explain why visa applicants in most other countries and regions can schedule their visa interviews online for free, which is efficient, accurate, and cost-effective.",
