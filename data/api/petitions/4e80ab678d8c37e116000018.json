  "body": "My name is Alexandra Allred. My son Tommy and I met President Obama in 2007 when we came to Washington to protest air pollution in our hometown of Midlothian, Texas. Pollution caused Tommy to develop chronic asthma, and the President promised us he\u2019d fight for clean air. But the administration\u2019s recent decision to further delay long overdue smog protections was a very disappointing step backwards.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m calling on the President to honor his promise to Tommy and protect the health of Americans by working as hard as he can to keep dangerous pollutants like mercury, carbon and soot out of our air.\r\n\r\nWe're depending on President Obama to stand with the children most affected by polluted air, scientists and public health experts and deliver on his promise for clean air.",
