  "body": "Abstinence-only education is a hazard to our children. Studies have shown that teen pregnancy rates are the highest in states (New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, Mississippi, etc) where abstinence-only sex education is taught. And lowest in states where safe-sex education is taught (New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, Minnesota, North Dakota). Instead of teaching our children to abstain from sex all together and to fear it, the US should encourage safe sexual practices that promote the use of condoms and birth control. Ignoring the fact that our kids will engage in sexual activity regardless of what they are told is not a healthy perspective to maintain. Instead, the US should ban abstinence-only programs in US public schools and reform the sexual education curriculum.",
