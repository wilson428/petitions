  "body": "Unlike most government programs, Social Security has its own dedicated tax and is solvent until 2036. \r\n\r\nSen. Bernie Sanders, in S. 1558, has proposed gradually removing the income subject to the Social Security tax, which would make it solvent for 75 years, and able to pay full benefits.\r\n\r\nRemoving the cap would also make this a flat rather than regressive tax.\r\n\r\nSupport this bill and refuse to support any \"reform\" such as privatizing, means testing, or raising the eligibility age that would weaken it for those who need it most in the working and middle class.\r\n\r\nSen. Sanders reform would strengthen the program whereas anything proposed by Wall St. would would take the \"security.\"\r\n\r\nWashington has done enough for Wall St.  It's time to protect average Americans from them.",
