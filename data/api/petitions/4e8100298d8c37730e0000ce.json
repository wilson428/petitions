  "body": "The Government Pension Offset and the Windfall Elimination Provision deny earned Social Security benefits to more than 1.5 million Americans, mostly women. They were designed to cut costs for Soc. Sec. and  were hastily voted into law without careful study.  This has resulted in the formulas that they use for persons who have earned pensions from non-SS covered government jobs being more punitive than the SS measures that they were supposed to replicate.  The S.S. benefits were earned in work not related to their government work, or by being a dependent spouse. These govt. pensions were earned and are taxed differently by the Federal government.  There is no valid reason for linking them to Social Security.  See \"More Info\" on SSFairness.com for references to CRS and NCPSSM reports. ",
