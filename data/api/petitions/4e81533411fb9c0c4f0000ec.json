  "body": "Using the information PFC Bradley Manning allegedly revealed, media outlets have published thousands of stories, detailing countless attempts by governments around the world -- including our own -- to illegally conceal evidence of human rights abuses.\r\n \r\nAccording to the President, \u201cemployees with the courage to report wrongdoing are a government\u2019s best defense against waste, fraud and abuse.\u201d\r\n \r\nIt appears that PFC Manning acted on his conscience, at great personal risk, to answer the President\u2019s call.  \r\n\r\nHowever, he has been subjected to extreme confinement conditions that US legal scholars have said may amount to torture.\r\n \r\nTherefore, we also ask the Obama administration to stop blocking the UN's chief torture investigator, Juan Mendez, from conducting an official visit with PFC Manning.",
