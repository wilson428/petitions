  "body": "I was the Officer working around Jason as a supervisor. I am now retired and feel it to be a moral imperative that this man (locked up on a first offense as a teenager)  be set free. Nine years locked up more than meet the requirements of most any State. A similar offense in California would have netted a person less than a year. Jason has been the ideal inmate while I worked in the prison and I am confident he will make an excellent free citizen. It makes absolutely no sense to waste tax dollars on Jason's further incarceration.",
