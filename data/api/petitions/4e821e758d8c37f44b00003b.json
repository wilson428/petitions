  "body": "The U.S. Army unnecessarily subjects monkeys to a simulated nerve agent attack in an outdated training exercise that is part of chemical casualty management courses held at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.\r\n\r\nMonkeys are injected with a toxic overdose of physostigmine to produce cholinergic crisis, marked by symptoms that include cessation of breathing, involuntary defecation, and violent seizures. Veterinary records show that these monkeys suffer both during and after the exercise.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being cruel, this training is subpar due to the availability of superior human-based training methods such as advanced medical simulators. Please sign the petition calling for an immediate halt to the use of animals for this training exercise in order to improve military readiness.",
