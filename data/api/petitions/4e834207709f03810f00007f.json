  "body": "Cutting 17% of your business to save roughly 5% on operating expenses doesn't add up.  But that is exactly what the USPS is proposing-- drastic changes to their business model, the most radical of which is eliminating Saturday mail delivery.  This is not a sensible solution to preserve the economic health of the USPS.\r\n \r\nThe USPS\u2019 unique model offers affordable universal service to every address, six days a week, as mandated by the Constitution.  This uniform rate structure ensures efficient mail delivery to even the most rural locations--where competitors either won't deliver or charge high premiums for Saturday delivery.\r\n \r\nMaintaining six-day delivery of mail is vital to preserving the economic health of the Postal Service.",
