  "body": "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is enforcing shoreline management rules decades after hydroelectric projects were first developed. Retroactive rules are irrational, without reason, or scientific basis. The burden of this regulation far out weights any public benefit. The impact on surrounding communities cannot be exaggerated as FERC rules are discouraging private investment, lowering property values, killing jobs, limiting access to project waters, inhibiting landowner\u2019s ability to sell, violating Federal, State and local ordinances, and trampling on personal property rights. FERC is ignoring Executive Order 13563 and the 11 July 2011 supplemental order for Independent Agencies. Wise regulatory decisions depend on careful analysis of the likely consequences of regulation.",
