  "body": "F1 visas issued to international students from certain countries such as mainland China are typically valid for less than the duration of the intended academic program (e.g. 1 year). Visa renewal is expensive and time consuming. The duration of validity should be extended to be commensurate with the intended academic program (typically 2 yr for master's and 5 yr for Ph.D.). An alternative approach is to allow renewal of F1 visa prior to the travel, so that in case the renewal is denied, the student would be given a chance to consider a later date of travel to avoid unexpected interruption of study and teaching. This would also prevent international students from risking their safety to renew their visas in neighboring countries, such as Mexico which is currently suffering from drug wars.",
