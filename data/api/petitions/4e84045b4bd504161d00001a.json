  "body": "Many workers come to the USA following all laws and regulations. They obtain valid and legal visas and come to work here temporarily.\r\nMany of these visas, such as the H1B visa (skilled workers such as software engineers), are valid for 2 consecutives periods of 3 years. When it is time to renew, these people have to exit the country to get a stamp. Often getting stuck outside the USA while their work and home is here. Why can't we do the bureaucratic checks here in the USA? They are already in the country? Why do they have to wait a few weeks or months while someone in a consulate or embassy forwards their paper work to someone here in the USA!? Just do that same paperwork, but, from the USA. There are no security reasons; i.e. they are already in the USA.",
