  "body": "NASA Administrator Charles Bolden's decision about which cities would get a retired space shuttle was based on a flawed assessment of applications. NASA also ignored the intent of Congress to consider regional diversity when determining shuttle locations. Even more insulting to taxpayers is that having paid to build the shuttles, they will now be charged to see them at some sites.\r\n\r\nNew York, which received the decommissioned Enterprise space shuttle under the premise that it would house it in the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum, now plans to build a separate museum for the Enterprise.\r\n\r\nNew York City is unprepared to house the Enterprise Shuttle while the National Museum of the USAF at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is the ideal location.  Please help boost the Ohio economy!",
