  "body": "The US military fails to provide Equal Opportunity for non-religious service members. \r\n\r\nWe are forced to participate in religious rituals during official ceremonies. This is not free exercise, this is forced exercise. Worship belongs in voluntary services, not in mandatory formations. This is unconstitutional establishment of an official preference for religion over non-religion.\r\n\r\nWe are forced to take an unconstitutional religious test for \u201cSpiritual Fitness\u201d. Those who fail the test are forced to take remedial training instructing them to go to church and pray. This proselytization by the US military is forced onto us against our will.\r\n\r\nThese policies create a hostile environment, division, and resentment within the military, destroying morale and threatening national security.",
