These bright & highly skilled graduates/workers provide breakthroughs and innovation resulting in start-up companies/business & tremendous job creation within US across many industries.\r\n\r\nIf they go back due to the lack of GREEN CARD availability (backlog due to visa numbers), they will create same innovation in their countries and beat U.S. Also U.S. companies might send jobs to the countries where the talent goes.\r\nUnemployment rate is only 2-3 % in highly skilled occupation, so they are not taking U.S. jobs. \r\n\r\nEconomy will get a major boost because of these bright Masters degree and PhD. holders if they stay in U.S. via a QUICK legislation/reform of providing them immediate GREEN CARDS.",
