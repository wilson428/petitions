  "body": "\r\nThe term euthanasia is from the Greek meaning \"good death.\"  Carbon monoxide gas chambers are definitely not a \"good death\", as animals slowly suffocate to death, sometimes taking 45 minutes and multiple gassings in order to die. Animals cry, bite one another, and bleed out of their cavities, all while fully conscious. Although some states have already banned the use of these cruel chambers, this archaic practice should be banned on a national level. It is inhumane, more expensive than Pentobarbital injection and most importantly, dangerous to shelter workers. Companion animals have been bred for the purposes of bringing mankind joy, and they deserve a respectful death. \"The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated\" - Ghandi.\r\n",
