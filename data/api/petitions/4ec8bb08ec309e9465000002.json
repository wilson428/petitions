  "body": "We feel Gen. (Ret) Sarath Fonseka\u2019s incarceration is illegal, and goes against all that Sri Lanka should achieve as a democratic nation.\r\n\r\nPresident Mahinda Rajapakse over the past 6 years has systematically eroded the democratic fabric of Sri Lanka by usurping the powers of the judiciary, law enforcement branches and other key bodies, through politicizing the organs of a democratic system, and through his refusal to implement the 17th amendment to the Constitution.  \r\n\r\nThe manner in which Gen Fonseka was charged and sentenced goes against the norms and previous practices of the law of Sri Lanka. His abduction and incarceration, following his bid for Presidency , perfectly illustrate the erosion of the rule of law, and the systemic and violent silencing of political opposition in Sri Lanka.",
