  "body": "In the recent decision memorandum by CMS regarding Intensive Behavioral Therapy for Obesity (CAG-00423N) the agency determined that potentially lifesaving preventive services for Obesity could only be furnished by primary care providers in the primary care setting. As a result, CMS has eliminated the most qualified providers, notably Registered Dietitians (RDs), along with clinical psychologists and other specialists who have been able to produce the best results for patients. The decision prevents this group from directly billing for services and from providing services outside of primary care, and limits access for older patients to qualified professionals that would help manage chronic disease.
