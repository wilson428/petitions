  "body": "Every child in America deserves access to an effective school library program.  We ask that the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) provide dedicated funding to help support effective school library programs.  Such action will ensure more students have access to the resources and tools that constitute a 21st century learning environment.  Reductions in school library programs are creating an \u2018access gap\u2019 between schools in wealthier communities versus those where there are high levels of poverty.  All students should have an equal opportunity to acquire the skills necessary to learn, to participate, and to compete in today\u2019s world.",
