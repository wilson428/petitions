  "body": "We expect candidates for federal office to follow our campaign finance laws, but the FEC \u2013 the agency charged with enforcing those laws \u2013 is completely dysfunctional.\r\n\r\nThree of the six commissioners staunchly refuse to enforce the law and five of the six are serving despite expired terms.\r\n\r\nPrior to your election, you professed support for campaign finance reform. We agree with you that the Citizens United Supreme Court decision was disastrous and the failure of Congress to require disclosure of campaign-related spending was outrageous.  Nevertheless, you have failed to appoint new commissioners who actually would enforce such laws.\r\n\r\nTo restore some faith into the democratic process, we urge you to nominate new commissioners to the FEC prior to the 2012 elections.  \r\n",
