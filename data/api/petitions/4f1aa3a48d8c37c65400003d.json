  "body": "Recently on FOX News former Senator Chris Dodd said (as quoted on news site TechDirt), \"Those who count on quote 'Hollywood' for support need to understand that this industry is watching very carefully who's going to stand up for them when their job is at stake. Don't ask me to write a check for you when you think your job is at risk and then don't pay any attention to me when my job is at stake,\" This is an open admission of bribery and a threat designed to provoke a specific policy goal. This is a brazen flouting of the \"above the law\" status people of Dodd's position and wealth enjoy.\r\n\r\nWe demand justice. Investigate this blatant bribery and indict every person, especially government officials and lawmakers, who is involved. ",
