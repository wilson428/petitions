  "body": "The present Administration, through the Health and Human Services Department, is mandating that all employer healthcare insurance plans provide coverage for procedures which violate the beliefs of the Catholic Church, and Catholic institutions.\r\n\r\nBasically, the new rules require the Catholic Church, and the institutions operating faithfully under the aegis of the Church, to provide coverage for contraceptive drugs and procedures. This requirement violates the beliefs of the Church. \r\n\r\nNever before has the United States Government deigned to represent \"transcendental truth\" on matters of conscience for any religion within these United States. That in itself is unprecedented, which is also why it is unconstitutional. \r\n\r\nSign to Let the present Administration know that this mandate cannot stand.",
