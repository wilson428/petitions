  "body": "Thanks to the Obama administration, nearly all women will soon have access to birth-control coverage at no cost. It\u2019s a huge victory for our country, where 99 percent of women use birth control at some point in their lives. \r\n\r\nIn developing this policy that will significantly improve women\u2019s health, the Obama administration resisted a pressure campaign from anti-contraception groups. These groups wanted to allowed many employers, including universities and hospitals, to refuse to cover birth control. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, those anti-contraception groups continue to call on the White House to rescind its policy. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s up to pro-choice Americans to speak up for birth-control coverage. Sign your name to let the administration know that you are with them 100 percent. \r\n",
