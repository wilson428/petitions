  "body": "Since 2007, the Vietnamese government has continuously waged brutal crackdown against human rights advocates, arresting and/or detaining notables such as: Rev. Nguyen Van Ly, Nobel Peace Prize nominees Ven.Thich Quang Do and Dr.Nguyen Dan Que, blogger Dieu Cay, and most recently songwriter Viet Khang, who merely expressed love for freedom and patriotism through songs he posted online. Congress has responded by introducing the Vietnam Human Rights Act, Vietnam Human Rights Sanctions Act and just last month, H Res 484. We implore you, Mr. President, to leverage Vietnam\u2019s desire for the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Generalized System of Preferences to force the immediate and unconditional release of all detained or imprisoned human rights champions. Show the world America puts freedom first.",
