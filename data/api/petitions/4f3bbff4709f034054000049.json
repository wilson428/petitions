  "body": "The end of this year is our best opportunity to secure the revenue and resources we need to reclaim the economy and rebuild the American dream for working people and the middle class. That's when the Bush tax cuts are set to expire. It's also when the massive budget cuts to defense spending and other programs, negotiated last summer, will take effect.\r\n\r\nMoveOn.org is calling on President Obama to seize this opportunity today by committing to vetoing any deal Republicans put in front of him that extends the Bush tax cuts for the richest 1%.\r\n\r\nThe increased tax revenue from ending these cuts will fix and build infrastructure, fund education, care for the elderly who depend on Medicare, and help grow the innovative energy and information economies of the future.",
