  "body": "On behalf of Penny4NASA.net:\r\n\r\nCurrently, NASA\u2019s budget barely surpasses 0.5 percent of the Federal budget, and has seen a steady decline in the proportions of its funding, now reaching all-time lows.  The cultural mindset brought on by NASA has allowed us to reap the benefits of economic growth, creating an influx of people wanting to become scientists and engineers.\r\nThere is no question that the government has money to fund NASA: $850 billion was spent on the bank bailout, several hundred billion dollars more than the 53 year running budget of NASA.  If we want to invest in our future, we must fund NASA at higher levels.\r\n\r\nTomorrow is gone without NASA.  Please at least double NASA\u2019s annual budget, and continue to support the most inspirational program in the country.\r\n \r\n",
