As a result of gruesome military expansionism, Japan changed \u201cEast Sea\u201d (the original name of sea bordered by Korea, Russia, and Japan) to \u201cSea of Japan\u201d in 1928\r\n\r\n\uf06c\t2. Korea was liberated in 1945, but Japan still refuses to return \u201cEast Sea\u201d to its original identity. \r\n\r\n\uf06c\t3. Our veterans were the major force defeating Japan in World War II. We helped Korea to regain its freedom.\r\n\r\n\uf06c\t4. However, we are still teaching our children a FALSE history that was manipulated by the invader who attacked \u201cPearl Harbor\u201d.\r\n\r\n   Please join us and sign this petition to correct a FALSE history in our textbooks.  Our children have right to learn a TRUE history!\r\n",
