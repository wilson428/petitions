  "body": "A new report has revealed that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are finally admitting that principal reductions for homeowners who are underwater actually work. Leading economists, government agencies, and leaders have been saying it all along: reducing the principal on homes that are worth less than their mortgages produces a positive financial benefit for homeowners, taxpayers, and the country as a whole. Ed DeMarco, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency -- which oversees Fannie and Freddie -- has stood in the way of reductions and he's claimed the support of Fannie and Freddie. But that's no longer the case. Even Fannie and Freddie now support principal reductions. It's time for Ed DeMarco to step aside, and time for President Obama to step in and act on behalf of struggling Americans.",
