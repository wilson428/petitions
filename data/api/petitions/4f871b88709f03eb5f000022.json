  "body": "We have a right to know how the food we eat and feed our families is produced, but under current FDA regulations, we don\u2019t have that ability when it comes to genetically engineered foods (GMOs).\r\n\r\nMore than forty countries, including Russia and China, already require labels on genetically engineered foods. And a recent poll found that nearly all Democrats (93%), Independents (90%), and Republicans (89%) support labeling of GMOs. At a time when partisan rancor dominates the public conversation, there are few topics that can muster such overwhelming support.\r\n\r\nAnd although over 1 million people submitted comments in favor of labeling, the FDA has yet to act.\r\n\r\nPresident Obama, please listen to the American public and speak out in favor of the mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods.\r\n",
