  "body": "We should definitely keep the Sea of Japan as it is now.\r\n\r\n\uf06c\t1. Contrary to the Korean claim that Japan changed \u201cEast Sea\u201d to \u201cSea of Japan\u201d in 1928, the Sea of Japan has always been the Sea of Japan, since the beginning of time.\r\n\r\n\uf06c\t2. South Koreans are under heavy communism influence because of communist North Korea, and have forgotten about the massive American blood spilled to defend them from the North Korean invasion aided by Russians and Communist Chinese during the Korean War in the '50s. Now they want the American forces out. Their extreme ethnocentricity blinds them and they want to rewrite history per their stories. That is plain wrong.\r\n\r\nPlease join us and sign this petition to stop FALSIFYING history in our textbooks. Our children have right to keep learning a TRUE history!",
