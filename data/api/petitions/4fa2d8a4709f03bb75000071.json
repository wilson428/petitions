  "body": "Jacob Ostreicher, an American, has been suffering in a Bolivian prison for more than 11 months. He is being held without a shred of evidence. \r\n\r\nOn 09/23/2011, the judge ordered his release based on evidence submitted by the defense, just days later the same judge reversed his decision and was promoted. A new judge resigned after 5 scheduled hearings.\r\n\r\nWe expect that in times of need, our government will be serious about, adamant enough, and powerful enough, to provide its citizens protection and asylum. \r\n\r\nIn your capacity as President of the U.S., we urge you to exercise the powers vested in you, to see to it that Jacob does not spend another day in this anarchic prison\r\n\r\nWith all avenues having been exhausted, it is up to you, Mr. President to make sure an innocent man walks free.",
