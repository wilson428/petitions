  "body": "False accusations regarding the South Korean comfort women issue have disgraced the people of Japan for decades. Over the past few years it has come to light that many of the original charges were false or completely fabricated.\r\n\r\nYet despite this new information, the United States continues to lend credence to the original false charges by memorializing the comfort women in a monument in New Jersey and a street name in New York. Not only is this perpetrating historical untruths, but it also leads unnecessary racial conflict and suffering of people of Japanese ancestry.\r\n\r\nWe strongly request President Obama to remove the monument and not to support any international harassment related to this issue against the people of Japan.\r\n\t\t\t\t",
