  "body": "In \"Discount Japan\" campaign, using holocaust  image conveniently, South Korea takes advantage of  Seiji Yoshida's creation  \"comfort women\" which later he confessed a fiction.\r\nOral testimonies are not evidence of coercing or abduction!\r\n\r\nThe House Resolution 121 in 2007 is based on fabrication. It gives South Korea a path to accuse Japan for its deed during WWII therefore to justify their murder, abduction, and invasion of Takeshima islands which has abundant of methane hydrate.\r\n\r\nIf US-Japan alliance is truly the cornerstone of US security interests in Asia and the Pacific and is fundamental to regional stability and prosperity, do NOT allow Koreans to deteriorate it. We strongly request US government to act only based on truth and justice!\r\n\r\nhttp://bit.ly/Repeal121",
