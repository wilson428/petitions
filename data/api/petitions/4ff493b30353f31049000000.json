  "body": "This petition is so it can be brought to the attention of the white house that one of our citizens is in need of help. His name is D. Randall Blythe. He was doing what he loves to do bring his music along with the rest of the band LAMB OF GOD. During one of the dates he was taken into custody in Prague and was extorted for money after posting bail he was not released which is a direct violation of his civil rights. This petition will show that the people of the united states will not stand for this outrage and hope you and the us state department will do something about this travesty.",
