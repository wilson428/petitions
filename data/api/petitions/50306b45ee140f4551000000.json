  "body": "Vietnam's Land Laws of 1993 and 2003 nationalized land and houses seized from Vietnamese who had fled communism, including as many as 500,000 Vietnamese who had already become naturalized US citizens. This makes the Vietnamese government ineligible for the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and for US foreign assistance under the Hickenlooper Amendment.  Our President should demonstrate his commitment to defending the rights and interests of US citizens by applying the prohibition clause of the Foreign Assistance Act (22 USC 2370(e)) to Vietnam, calling on its government to freeze further expropriations of US properties, and conditioning GSP or any further trade benefits on the return of all properties that belong to US citizens or payment of fair compensation.",
