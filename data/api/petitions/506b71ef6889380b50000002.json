  "body": "The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act required Health and Human Services to set a gluten-free labeling rule by 2008 to aid people with celiac disease, a life-threatening autoimmune condition. The only known treatment is a strict gluten-free diet. \r\n\r\nAn estimated 3 million Americans have celiac and even more may have non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Without adequate labeling, those on a medically prescribed gluten-free diet struggle to make safe food choices and stay well.\r\n\r\nChildren with celiac cannot participate in the National School Lunch Program when food service staff cannot determine if products are gluten-free. \r\n\r\nCongress did its part by passing the law. It is up to the White House to protect the health of millions of adults and children by finalizing the rule NOW. ",
