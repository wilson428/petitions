  "body": "The volunteers and supporters of the March of Dimes ask the President to light the White House in purple on January 3, 2013, to honor the 75th anniversary of the founding of the March of Dimes by President Franklin Roosevelt, and as a symbol of hope for families whose children have been born too soon.  Just as the March of Dimes galvanized America to defeat polio, today millions of March of Dimes volunteers are working to support research and programs to identify the causes of premature birth.  Help to honor babies born prematurely by lighting in purple the birthplace of the March of Dimes:  the White House.",
