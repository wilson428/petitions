  "body": "Religious institutions across our great nation serve an important role in community building & out reach, helping the poor & disenfranchised, among many other noble actions. \r\n\r\nOur forefathers had the foresight to see that for our nation to succeed, we would need to enforce an unparalleled freedom of religion.  However, they also understood the imperative need for a legal separation between church & state.  \r\n\r\nIn recent years, the IRS has turned a blind eye to offending Religious institutions that mix religion with politics.  By not enforcing the qualifications & disqualification's of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c) of the United States tax code, the IRS is doing a diservice to both the American people & the vision of our forefathers.  \r\n\r\nWe ask that you enforce the letter of the law.",
