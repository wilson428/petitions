  "body": "The purpose of this petition is to ask the United States Government to repeal the Defense of Marriage (DOMA) as it is unconstitutional. \r\n\r\nIt does not allow everyone in the United States to be treated as equals. Sign here to have DOMA repealed.\r\n\r\nThe ability to love is in a human being's very DNA. It shouldn't matter if we want to be with someone of a different race, religion or nationality. It should definitely not matter if its even someone of the same gender.\r\n\r\nSign for the freedom to love!",
