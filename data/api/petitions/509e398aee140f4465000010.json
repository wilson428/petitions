  "body": "It has become blatantly obvious the voter fraud that was committed during the 2012 Presidential elections.  In one county alone in Ohio, which was a battleground state, President Obama received 106,258 votes...but there were only 98,213 eligible voters.  It's not humanly possible to get 108% of the vote!\r\nIf ID laws had been enforced (which the administration is completely against because that meant they would lose) then this wouldn't be an issue.\r\nRecount NOW!\r\n",
