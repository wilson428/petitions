We therefore as free men and women of our great state do believe that it is time to take matter upon ourselves to ensure our continued freedom, and to enact our own laws and here buy govern ourselves without the federal government's involvement in our internal matters from this day forward. \r\n\r\nThey who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.\r\nBenjamin Franklin: 1775",
