  "body": "Chris Williams is a Montana man who opened up a Medical Marijuana production facility after 62% of voters approved the law in his state. Chris William's operated his facility according to the law that was passed by Montana voters. \r\n\r\nHowever, his facility was raided by the Federal Government in March of 2011, and he was charged for operating the grow facility.\r\n\r\nMr. Williams was convicted and is facing 80 years in prison. He has been offered numerous plea deals to reduce his sentence, but has refused them because he believes he has committed no crime. \r\n\r\nMr. William's sentence, a sentence that will take him away from his family for the rest of his life, is most certainly cruel and unusual. \r\n\r\nWe call on President Obama to review the facts of the case and grant Mr. Williams a full Pardon.
