  "body": "President Obama has been clear on health care: \"if you like your plan, you can keep it.\" This petition is nothing more than holding The President of The United States to his word. We The People should be allowed to keep our current health care plan plans--just as certain other groups have been allowed to keep theirs. \r\n\r\nThe Obama administration has allowed unions like the SEIU, lobbyists like the AARP and certain businesses to opt out of ObamaCare [the so called Affordable Care Act]. This petition asks that We The People be granted the right to opt out of the ACA legislation and its mandates. ",
