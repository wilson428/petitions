  "body": "Federal employees have had a pay freeze for the past several years and the pay and benefits for the federal workforce have been under serious attack during the national elections held this year.\r\n\r\nGiving federal employees an extra holiday on December 24th, 2012 would be a good gesture to improve morale of the federal workforce.\r\n\r\nThis is also consistent with past practice. President Obama provided a half-day off on Christmas Eve, Thursday, December 24, 2009. President George W. Bush provided a half-day holiday on Wednesday, Dec. 24, 2002, as well as several full days off the day before or after Christmas: Tuesday, December 24, 2001, Thursday, December 26, 2003, Tuesday, December 24, 2007, and Thursday, December 26, 2008.\r\n\r\nWe urge President Obama to issue an executive order on this issue.",
