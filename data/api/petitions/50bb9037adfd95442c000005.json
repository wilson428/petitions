  "body": "Tens of thousands of illegally imprisoned Falun Gong believers have been used as a living organ bank, killed on demand to fuel China\u2019s lucrative organ transplant industry, as outlined in this video: http://goo.gl/CcHPe. \r\n\r\nThe U.S. State Department\u2019s 2011 Human Rights Report cited allegations of organ harvesting from Falun Gong believers and other prisoners of conscience. In October, 106 members of Congress wrote to Secretary Clinton requesting further information. Two Congressional hearings have covered the topic. Leading transplantation doctors and medical organizations worldwide have condemned this crime against humanity.\r\n\r\nAs a world leader in protecting human rights, the U.S. has a moral obligation to expose these crimes, stop them, and ensure the perpetrators are brought to justice.",
