  "body": "Congress and the President must forfeit their pay and healthcare benefits until the fiscal cliff is resolved. And they must pass a solution, not a stop-gap. \r\n\r\nAnd, if they miss the Jan 1 deadline, all of Congress and the President must take a permanent 15% pay cut. Their pay cannot be raised for two years.\r\n\r\n\"The American People\" that both sides constantly regale live in this sort of world (do your job or don't get paid). If it is good enough for us, it's good enough for them.",
