  "body": "Korea's territorial rights over Dokdo are indisputable, historically and geographically, and are not subject to a territorial dispute with Japan.This dispute over Dokdo is a historical problem that arose from Japan's expansionist invasion of Korea.This dispute may not be settled in or out of court unless Japan accepts the responsibility of the historical fact. The Republic of Korea has continuously administered Dokdo since 1948. \r\nJapan has tried to claim Dokdo as their territory and wants to take Korea to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The petition by \u201chisa a\u201d refers to \u201cRusk Documents\u201d which were confidential during the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty negotiations and are anecdotal now and have no legality that can support Japan\u2019s territorial ownership of Dokdo.\r\n",
