  "body": "Every week it seems that we are facing a new headline of mass shootinngs -two in the last week alone. The consitutution gives us the right to bear arms and no one wants to take that right away, but we need real gun control reform.\r\n\r\nBackground checks, restricted access to semi-automatic weapons, waiting periods, all need to be part of a robust gun control policy that will allow people to keep thier guns but provide a responsible framework to gun ownership. \r\n\r\nWe need to have a conversation and we are looking to the White House to take the lead on this.
