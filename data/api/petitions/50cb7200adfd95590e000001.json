  "body": "On December 14, 2012, a gunman or gunmen opened fire at the Sandy Hook Elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. Initial reports list 27 dead, including 14 children.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, believe that the United States can no longer wait for a sensible conversation on gun control. We call on Pres. Obama and his administration to begin a national dialog with members of Congress, federal regulators, firearms manufacturers and distributors, and interested citizens to formulate a commonsense regulation of firearms to keep them out of the hands of disturbed or evil individuals and protect our children from death in their own schools.\r\n\r\nIt is long past time to begin this conversation. Now is the time.",
