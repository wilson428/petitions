  "body": "Every time a mass shooting happens in the United States, we are told by the White House, the federal government and its benefactors in the NRA that, \"Now is not the time\" to have a conversation about increased regulation of firearms. Ostensibly, this is because it's too close to the just-occurred tragedy, but really, it's because our leaders have their hands in the pockets of one of the richest lobbying organizations in the country. \r\n\r\nSo, if \"now\" is not the time to have a conversation about gun control, let's set a time. Over 20 people died today - more than five times as many as died in the Benghazi embassy attack, which event prompted Congressional hearings and mass apoplexy from Republican leaders. Now may not be the time to have the conversation, but it's time to schedule it. Now.",
