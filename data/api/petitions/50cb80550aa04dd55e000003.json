  "body": "Before the last of the victims were even found at the Newtown, CT school massacre, White House press spokesman Jay Carney stated that \"today is not the day\" to discuss, at long last, the urgent need for a sane overhaul of our nation's gun laws.\r\n\r\nWe urgently disagree. If we cannot discuss prevention of massacres like this one while the pain is still fresh, then our opportunities to have that discussion will be few and far between. The frequency of these horrifying incidents is increasing.\r\n\r\nIf a day on which two dozen schoolchildren are massacred is not the day to discuss this, there never will be a proper day for the discussion.\r\n\r\nStand up to the entrenched gun lobby now. The White House must take the lead on enacting strict controls on all firearms in the US. ",
