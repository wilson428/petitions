  "body": "If teachers and principals are armed and trained to defend themselves during a school attack there would be fewer casualties and less attempts to attack schools.\r\n\r\nFact: Crime rates decrease when the people are better armed. \r\n\r\nIt is time we gave our teachers the ability to defend themselves and stop pretending like a door buzzer is enough of a defense. Take a stand for school safety. Arm the teachers and principals today. A gun in every classroom will protect our students from massacres like the one in CT today.",
