  "body": "Today the world was shocked by the tragic events that occurred at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. Many are focusing on the debate about gun control - I would like to avoid that issue here. Behind many of these horrific events are damaged minds that may have been helped before they turned to violent acts. Due to social stigma, lack of government support, drug abuse, and often poverty, there are scores of Americans who are suffering from serious mental health problems without aid. We need to rethink how we treat mental illness in the US, and how we can help individuals long before they hurt themselves or others. Perhaps with the right actions these individuals could live normal lives, and would never get to the point of violent action. Let's speak openly & productively about mental health.",
