  "body": "As a nation we have security in malls, banks, hospitals, airports & more.  The Government should require Security where it is most desperately needed; the entrance to every school nationwide.  We, as parents, have entrusted schools with the education & safety of our children, whom the future of this country depends upon.  There is absolutely no excuse for schools to be exempt from the unquestionable need for Security Guards, as well as extra security measures being in place where they are not as of yet. We should not have to endure another horrific tragedy in order to have such changes immediately implemented.  This is a simple yet strongly effective step towards our schools being Safe & Sound; thereby contributing toward the comfort & safety that families nationwide undoubtedly deserve. \r\n",
