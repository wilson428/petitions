  "body": "Encourage congress to shift funding from prisons back into the mental health system to re-open hospitals and provide long-term treatment to people with mental illnesses instead of waiting until they commit a crime and placing them in jail.  Open more long term care facilities and lengthen the allowable stay for appropriate treatment and stabilization.  Authorize police to transport mentally ill patients to hospitals without requiring them to have first committed a crime.  Reestablish the rights of legal guardians of mentally incapacitated people to voluntarily sign their wards into a long term care facility without requiring another court order.  ",
