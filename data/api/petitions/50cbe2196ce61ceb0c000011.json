  "body": "People haven't learned from history that gun control is a folly.  It only serves to disarm those who are law abiding citizens in order to have \"feel good\" legislation instead of getting at the actual root of the problem.  \r\n\r\nYou will never legislate away criminal behavior and those that would harm others en masse are not going to be stopped by some law.  The unfortunate thing is, that we will continue to have a Columbine, a Clackamas Town Center, and school killings even if legislation is passed further restricting gun rights. People have done this in many ways throughout history and no legislation has ever stopped it completely.  The latest school shooting is tragic.  We agree but making more Gun Free Zones only caters to those who do not follow signs and makes everyone else defenseless.",
