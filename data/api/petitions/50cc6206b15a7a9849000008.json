  "body": "Please respectfully consider this message on behalf of the tens of millions of law-abiding American gun owners who believe it is unethical, unconstitutional, and unacceptable to be unjustly punished with additional gun laws restricting what specific types of weapons or magazines a person can own or purchase, given that we had absolutely no role in the senseless Newtown, CT tragedy, or any similar recent events.\r\n \r\nThe state of Connecticut already has a so-called \"assault weapons\" ban, considered by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence as one of the strictest in the entire nation, and it did absolutely nothing to prevent this unspeakable tragedy. This speaks volumes for how completely and utterly useless this type of legislation ultimately is in deterring and preventing violent crime.",
