  "body": "The goal of this petition is to make illegal the sale of assault rifles and high capacity magazines. While not an indictment of the 2nd Amendment, we feel the time has come to address the ambiguous language allowing citizens the right to bear arms. There can be no practical reason for non-military personnel to own these sorts of armaments.",
