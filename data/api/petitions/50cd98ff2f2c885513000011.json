  "body": "The Westboro Baptist Church operates as a tax-exempt church. While it speaks volumes that many Americans value their right to free speech, this does not mean that we have to pay for their vitriol.\r\n\r\nThe WBC is not and should never have been considered a legitimate church for tax-exemption purposes, and this could be declared so either directly or with legislation affirming any or all of the following:\r\n\r\n1) The WBC does not engage in any charity comparable in scope to their public image. They are only known for hate.\r\n\r\n2) The WBC is not inclusive of its surrounding community, restricting membership. It is regarded by some as a tax shelter for its family's law operations.\r\n\r\n3) The WBC uses invective speech under its name, actively denigrating classes of people - soldiers, homosexuals, and others",
