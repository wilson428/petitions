  "body": "The time has long since passed to bring the discussion on mental health in the US to the forefront. Aside from great tragedies that break hearts, there are private, lesser-discussed tragedies that happen each day due to the failures of our health care system to adequately support, evaluate, and treat those with mental illnesses.\r\n\r\nIt's time that federal funds were allocated to build-out mental health services, from inpatient facilities to national education platforms. Insurers must be compelled to offer mental health services at the same availability as they offer primary care services. \r\n\r\nWe need education. Compassion. Understanding. Resources. The criminalization and marginalization of mental illness must end. We must take it back from the criminal system and make it part of health CARE.",
