  "body": "My fellow Americans, it is time that we come to the realization of failed policies. In remembrance of the lives lost in this most recent tragedy we must band together to defend the right to bear arms more than ever. Understand that this occurred in an area which already has strict gun laws and also took place in a \"gun free zone.\" Now there is no way to predict how many lives could have been saved or if this could have been avoided altogether, but we will never know unless we take a step in the right direction of freedom and individual liberties. Let's empower the educators, not the criminals, because only criminals do not obey the laws and with this in mind there is no law that can change this fact. Liberty is safety, not laws, freedom and rights. So please, spread the message of liberty!",
