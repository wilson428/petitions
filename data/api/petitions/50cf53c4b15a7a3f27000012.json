  "body": "We have all witnessed that locks, cameras and other safety measures at our schools do not keep bad people from doing bad things. Schools across America are currently \"gun free\" zones which has also not deterred criminals. The only way to stop criminals from hurting our kids is to meet this force with an equal or greater force. Hiring security personnel may work for some schools but others run on budgets to tight to handle the extra costs. The solution would be to allow schools to have trained staff that carry weapons for the protection of students; much like what we do with our Air Marshall program for airlines and what they do in Israel to protect their school children. Leave the choice to the individual districts and/or schools if they want to have this option or not.",
