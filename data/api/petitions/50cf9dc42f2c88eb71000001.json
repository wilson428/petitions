  "body": "We urge President Obama to sign an Executive Order banning the sale of assault weapons and importantly the ammunition that these weapons use, effective immediately and until Congress acts to ban the sale and ownership of such weapons and ammunition.  \r\n \r\nThe increasing frequency of mass murder involving assault weapons and high-capacity magazines strongly suggests another unthinkable tragedy will occur before Congress acts to pass laws that address this threat.  These circumstances have created an imminent danger to innocent Americans, who just by being in a public gathering place in the course of normal daily life could become victim to such a horrific act.  \r\n\r\nNo one action will stop all threats - but don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.  We urge the President to do this now.\r\n",
