  "body": "     In light of the recent tragedy in Sandy Hook, CT, it has become apparent that locked doors, metal detectors, and unarmed security guards are not enough to stop murderers from getting into our schools. Enough is ENOUGH. In response, myself and a group of like-minded veterans have come together to offer a solution: VOW. VOW was created to employ veterans to work as armed security guards to protect and secure our schools children, staff, and property. Americans entrusted us to secure their freedoms overseas, now we are asking that Americans entrust us with our nations children. Americas kids are VOWs kids. It's time for a change America. Come check us out and see what we're about on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/VeteransOnWatch?ref=stream, or email  jd081787@gmail.com for more info",
