  "body": "Breed Specific Legislation should be considered a violation of our rights as stated in the 14th amendment of the United States Constitution! These laws are completely ineffective, biased and cause the loss of innocent family dogs based solely on their breed or physical characteristics! There are already \"Dangerous Dog Laws\" in place to handle dogs (regardless of breed) on an \"individual\" basis. This is just another form or pure hatred in this country that should not be allowed.\r\n",
