  "body": "We, the undersigned,\r\n- acknowledge the adoption of \"Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012\" as a profoundly pro-Russian step which will help Russian citizens bring individuals involved in corruption and violation of human rights to justice;\r\n- are outraged with the actions of Russian law-makers, who breached all imaginable boundaries of humanity, responsibility, or common sense and chose to jeopardize lives and well-being of thousands of Russian orphans, some of whom, the ill and the disabled ones, now might not have a chance of survival if the ban on international adoption is to be put in place;\r\n- urge this Administration to identify those involved in adopting such legislature responsible under \"Magnitsky Act\" and thus included to the relevant list.",
