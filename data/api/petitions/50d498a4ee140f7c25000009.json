  "body": "The Constitution of the United States was amended to protect the individual rights of citizens to bear arms for security.  There is no language in the constitution referring to \"hunting\" or a \"sporting purpose.\"  The reason for the right to keep and bear arms is to protect individual liberty from both foreign and domestic threats; and perhaps most importantly, against a tyrannical government.  In a quote attributed to Thomas Jefferson, \"The beauty of the Second Amendment is that it will not be needed until they try to take it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. President, please do not attempt to infringe upon these rights.",
