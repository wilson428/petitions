  "body": "On December 21, 2012, Russian Duma passed Federal Law 186614-6 that prohibits adoption of orphaned Russian children in the USA, as well as deprives Russian human rights advocates of the ability to work with American colleagues. \r\n\r\nThis law was prepared as a response to Magnitsky Act, and was preceded by a campaign of slander against orphan rehabilitation programs and human rights advocacy in the world. \r\n\r\nWe urge our political leaders, at minimum, to speak up against this primarily anti-humane act and make clear that acts of ideological revenge are unfitting for the international political arena. \r\n\r\nWe also ask that Magnitsky Act be extended to supporters of this law in Russian Duma.",
