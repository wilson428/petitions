  "body": "  We The People, ask the Obama administration to endorse and fully implement the National Rifle Association's National School Shield Program. \r\n  This program would give our children immediate protection from future tragedies Like the one that took place in Newtown, CT, by placing well trained armed guards to protect our children. We the people also wish to make clear that any further gun laws will do nothing to protect our children, but will only place more restrictions on the law abiding citizens' second amendment rights.",
