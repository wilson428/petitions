  "body": "there needs to be justice for the victims in the Steubenville, Ohio rape scandal. i'm requesting that this case be pushed up to the higher courts so that there is some real justice, also to allow for a jury trial for all involved. This is a  serious offense and this needs to be an example for everyone that this type of behavior should not, and will not be Tolerated in our society. i don't believe that the police or news in the area of the alleged crimes that are covering the story are truly trying to prosecute the accused, but rather cover up a scandal that has dramatically effected the lives of many individuals.",
