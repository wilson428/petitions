  "body": "Sen. Diane Feinstein has announced that she will be introducing new gun legislation in Jan 2013. The proposals of this legislation are in direct contradiction to both the spirit and letter of the Second Amendment of the Bill of Rights. Her blatant disregard for the rights of citizens, and willingness to make criminals of a large number of law abiding gun owners, needs to be addressed. The summary of the new proposals can be seen at:\r\nhttp://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve/?File_id=10993387-5d4d-4680-a872-ac8ca4359119\r\n\r\nPlease sign today, and write your elected representatives!",
