  "body": "Cancer is the number one disease killer in children, and seven kids die every day in the United States.   We must raise awareness to impact this mortality rate.  Changing this outcome requires awareness, and the President can lead this effort by lighting the White House gold for the month of September.  Gold represents both the pediatric cancer cause and the light that children provide in our lives.  We should honor them by shedding light on their battle.  The color of that light is gold.",
