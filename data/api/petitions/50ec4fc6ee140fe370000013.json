  "body": "Our democracy is broken, flooded by money from corporations, billionaires and SuperPACs that puts their interests over those of the public.  From big banks sinking our economy while blocking real reform to the NRA preventing sensible gun safety measures, big money forces are corrupting our politics. Since the US Supreme Court has ruled that corporations and wealthy donors have the right to spend unlimited money in our elections, a growing popular movement is now calling for a constitutional amendment to reclaim our democracy.  Eleven states and nearly 500 cities and towns have joined this call.  We petition President Obama to use the State of the Union to call for a constitutional amendment to reduce the influence of money in our political system and restore democracy to the people.",
