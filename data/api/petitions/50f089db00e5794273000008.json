  "body": "Recognize Acupuncturist as health care providers!\r\n\r\nDespite overwhelming evidence of the positive impact acupuncturist have on patient health, they are not recognized as healthcare providers under the Social Security Act and, therefore, cannot be paid by Medicare for therapy management . The Social Security Act does recognize other healthcare professionals such as dieticians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurse midwives, and clinical social workers.\r\n\r\nBy changing the compensation structure allowed under Medicare, we can ensure that patients have access to the medical expertise of Acupuncturist. Studies have shown that when an Acupuncturist is directly involved in patient care for pain management and other issues, the patient recovers quicker with less medication required.",
