  "body": "Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Heymann's overzealous prosecution of an allegedly minor and non-violent electronic crime led to the suicide of Aaron Swartz.  President Obama recently said, as repeated by Vice President Biden, \"if our actions result in saving only one life, they're worth taking.\"  We should not destroy the lives of human beings for crimes against computer systems that harm no one and provide no benefit to the perpetrator.  Such actions should be treated as forms of protest and civil disobedience.  To prosecute these actions the same as rapes and murders is a savage abuse of the criminal justice system which continues to destroy the lives of peaceful, productive members of society.\r\n\r\nFire Attorney Steve Heymann before his reckless prosecutions claim any more lives.",
