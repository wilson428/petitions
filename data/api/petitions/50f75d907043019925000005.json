  "body": "Stop the proposed mining in the Penokees! There is no such thing as a environmentally friendly mine. Without a doubt, this mine would severely pollute the Bad River watershed, and ultimately Lake Superior, the largest fresh water lake in the world. It would also harm the local economy and the health of people plants and animals in this region. This issue affects not only people from this region, but the entire country. This is about saving our most precious resource from devastation. ",
