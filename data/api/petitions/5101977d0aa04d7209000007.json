  "body": "The Librarian of Congress decided in October 2012 that unlocking of cell phones would be removed from the exceptions to the DMCA.\r\n\r\nAs of January 26, consumers will no longer be able unlock their phones for use on a different network without carrier permission, even after their contract has expired.\r\n\r\nConsumers will be forced to pay exorbitant roaming fees to make calls while traveling abroad. It reduces consumer choice, and decreases the resale value of devices that consumers have paid for in full.\r\n\r\nThe Librarian noted that carriers are offering more unlocked phones at present, but the great majority of phones sold are still locked.\r\n\r\nWe ask that the White House ask the Librarian of Congress to rescind this decision, and failing that, champion a bill that makes unlocking permanently legal.",
