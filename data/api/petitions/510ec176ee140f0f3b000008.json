  "body": "\tWe demand that your administration release Shaker Aamer, a prisoner since 2002 at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Shaker has been cleared for release by your administration, yet he remains indefinitely imprisoned without charge or trial. Shaker has been abused in U.S. custody and has also been held in solitary for prolonged periods of his imprisonment.\r\n\tShaker is a British resident with a wife and four young children. His youngest son, Faris, has not met his father. Wondering if he will ever be released, Shaker could not tolerate injustice and has peacefully protested for the human rights of all prisoners.\r\n\tShaker\u2019s confinement and separation from his family after being cleared for release are unacceptable and contrary to basic human values. You must take immediate action to release Shaker Aamer.",
