  "body": "The federal government should find the policy that exists in numerous states that allows the Board of Directors of a residential co-op or in some cases the Board of Managers of a condominium, to deny housing to a buyer of a home without providing the buyer with a reason for the denial, to be void as against public policy, and because it enables a third party (not the buyer or the seller), to engage in illegal discrimination with impunity.  The practice permits the BOD or the BOM to eliminate from entrance into the community, persons based upon their race, religion, ethnicity, familial status, etc., without accountability for the denial; in effect, providing them a license to break the law. Because the denial is from a third party, traditional testing is not an option to correct the problem",
