  "body": "Lama Al Ghamdi was a 5-year old Saudi girl who died in October 2012 after being raped, beaten, and burned by her own father. He tortured her by crushing her skull, breaking her ribs, breaking her arm, breaking her back and tearing her rectum, then trying to burn it closed. He confessed to these crimes because he accused her of not being a virgin, and was arrested a month AFTER she died. He was released four months later after paying $50,000 in \"blood money\".\r\n\r\nWe, the People of the United States of America, petition our government to:\r\n\r\n1) Become independent of foreign oil ASAP; and\r\n\r\n2) to cut diplomatic, economic, and all other ties to Saudi Arabia:\r\n\r\n a) until Fayhan Al Ghamdi is JUSTLY punished for these  crimes AND\r\n\r\n b) until Saudi Arabia improves its women's and human rights conditions.",
