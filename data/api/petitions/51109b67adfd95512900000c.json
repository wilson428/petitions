  "body": "Factory farms (FFs) raise billions of genetically modified, physically compromised animals for maximum meat, dairy, and egg production.  Feeling animals become objects of production.\r\n\r\nFFs are brutal.  For meat, animals like baby pigs have their teeth pulled out or testicles removed, all without anesthetic.  In dairy farms, cows are impregnated annually, only to have their babies taken from them and killed, and the milk they produce for their babies stolen and sold to humans.  And in egg \"farms,\" male chicks, who can't lay eggs, are suffocated, gassed, or macerated while alive.\r\n\r\nFFs also cause more global warming than cars.\r\n\r\nFinally, workers who slaughter animals suffer trauma and physical ailments because of taxing working conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is time we end the horrors of factory farms.",
