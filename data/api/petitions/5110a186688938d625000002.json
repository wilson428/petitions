  "body": "President Obama, the undersigned ask that our President please tell the US Navy to remove the Naval Flight Demonstration Squadron \"Blue Angels\" from sequestration cuts.  When the Blue Angels come to perform at air shows, the local economies attract aviation geeks - avgeeks for short - and the general public like a magnet to spend money and generate tax revenue.\r\n\r\nCertainly a lot more economic stimulus is created in our communities from Seattle to Virginia Beach than $40 million dollars each year. Furthermore, the U.S. Navy Blue Angels serve to recruit young people not just to the US Navy but also patriots of all ages to do good deeds for our great nation.\r\n\r\nFinally, Mr. President: WE PAY TAXES FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE AND THE BLUE ANGELS!  THANK YOU, POTUS.",
