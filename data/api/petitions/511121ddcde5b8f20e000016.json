  "body": "Women cannot be forced to rely on their employers to provide adequate time with their infant and family during the vulnerable time of attachment and transition after childbirth. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization along with virtually every other perinatal professional health care organization worldwide strongly recommends six months of exclusive breastfeeding for the health of mother, infant, and their community.  Yet, employed women are compelled to return to work after six very short weeks (milk production is barely established), Legislating insurance coverage of breast pumps and the provision of appropriate time and space for pumping by employers is inadequate.\r\nThe United States lags behind every other developed country in it's protection of familes.",
