  "body": "Dear Mr. President:\r\n\r\nYou face critical decisions on Afghanistan:\r\n\r\n1.How rapidly the remaining American troops are withdrawn from Afghanistan\r\n\r\n2.How many U.S. troops remain in that country after 2014\r\n\r\nWe believe the answer is clear: The troops should be removed as quickly as safely possible and no troops should remain after December 31, 2013.\r\n\r\nThe war has entered its twelfth year, which makes it America\u2019s longest war.\r\n\r\nThe war has claimed over 2,000 American lives, with more than 18,000 Americans wounded in combat. Our returning soldiers face PTSD and suicides are at an all-time high.\r\n\r\nThe conflict has already cost American taxpayers nearly $600 billion, and the price keeps rising.\r\n\r\nWe urge you to bring all American troops home from Afghanistan as expeditiously as possible.\r\n",
