  "body": "If a school has a library, you will find a librarian. If a school has a math department, you will find math teachers. Students become ill, so there is a nurse. Unfortunately, when a student-athlete sustains an injury, only about 42% of schools have access to a qualified health care professional who is capable of assessing and making return-to-participation decisions. We, the people, owe it to our youth to ensure they have the necessary qualified personnel, equipment, and emergency action plans, safety and medical protocols and procedures in place at every sporting event and facility.\r\n",
