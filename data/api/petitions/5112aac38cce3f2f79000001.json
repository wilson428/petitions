  "body": "Please demand legislation to repeal the infamous section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act and to rid this country once and for all of the so-called Right To Work statutes.  \r\n\r\nMany states are passing this legislation because they want the ability to obtain a job to be without bias and discrimination based on whether or not you are a part of the union.  Now that some of these laws have passed can we now say the opposite is true and RTW laws discriminate against folks who are union?  Every worker benefits from the union contract, but under so-called RTW laws, some pay absolutely nothing to the union that negotiates that contract. That encourages others to choose to pay nothing, and eventually the union unravels. \r\n\r\nRepeal 14(b)!",
