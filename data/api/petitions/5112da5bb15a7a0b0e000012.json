  "body": "The current USPS budget crisis was sparked by shortsighted and irresponsible Congressional legislation and abetted by a President.\r\n\r\nIn December of 2006, the 109th Congress passed (and President George W. Bush signed) the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, which required the USPS to have 75 years of health benefits for all its employees completely pre-funded by 2016, while forbidding it to set up profit-generating \"non-postal services\" like other countries' postal operations have.\r\n\r\nThese egregious regulations are unique to USPS and put it at an unfair disadvantage against competitors like FedEx. This law is an example of regulatory capture and job-killing overregulation at their worst. Please call on Congress to repeal PAEA and save an American institution",
