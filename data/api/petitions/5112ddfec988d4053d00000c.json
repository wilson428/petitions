  "body": "The Postmaster General, Patrick Donahoe, is abusing his position to undermine congress. He does not have the authority to eliminate six day delivery without congressional approval. His ineffective and inefficient leadership has worsened the financial condition of the United States Postal Service. We request that Patrick Donahoe be removed from his appointment as Postmaster General and a qualified and competent person with proven leadership ability from outside of the United States Postal Service be appointed in his place.",
