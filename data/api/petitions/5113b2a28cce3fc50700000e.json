  "body": "We would like the Obama administration to create an task force charged with investigating the potential national economic costs and benefits of ceasing the US mint's production of the the penny, and phasing the coin out of circulation within a period of 2-6 years. If, as in similar cases in other countries, it is determined that the penny costs the federal government more than it is worth, and that removing the coin from circulation has the potential for small business owners to save time and money, we would like this task force to recommend the nation abandon the penny.",
