  "body": "Bernie Ludvik was an inspirational teacher to many people in the small town of Crete, Nebraska. He was a Social Studies teacher from 1979- 2004. On November 26, 2012, Bernie Ludvik was involved in a severe car crash. He was air lifted to the hospital Bryan LGH West. He had a traumatic brain injury, a broken femur, and two broken vertebrae in his lower back. Mr. Ludvik had tickets to the Inauguration, but unfortunately was unable to make it because he was still hospitalized. The Crete High students have been working extremely hard to help make up for the fact that he did not get to go to attend the Inauguration. Our goal is to potentially get Ludvik to meet the President because he didn't get to attend the Inauguration. See more information here: on.fb.me/11qdskc",
