  "body": " The Obama Administration should take the initiative for the establishment of a UN's Commission of Inquiry (COI) into human rights abuses in North Korea at the UN Human Rights Council from 2/25/13 to 3/22/13. This COI would investigate the mistreatment of 200,000 political prisoners in North Korea, including Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American who was detained last year. UN officials support this COI because it would set up a detailed mechanism of inquiry of the North Korea's crimes against humanity. We urge US government to propose this COI so that this investigation would lead to a referral to the International Criminal Court like Darfur and would punish North Korean regime using all the resources on nuclear weapons program. Thank you for your consideration and look forward to your response.\r\n",
