  "body": "CDH is a birth defect that occurs when the diaphragm fails to fully form, allowing abdominal organs into the chest cavity and preventing lung growth.  50% of babies born with CDH do not survive. The remaining 50% endure long hospitalizations and complications. The cause is not known.\r\n\r\nCongenital Diaphragmatic Hernia occurs in 1 of every 2500 births; 1600 babies in the United States every year. Over a half million babies have been born with CDH since 2000. CDH is as common as Spina Bifida and Cystic Fibrosis but there is very little awareness and even less research.\r\n\r\nWe ask President Obama to light the White House in the CDH Awareness ribbon colors of blue, pink and yellow with clouds or with the international symbol of CDH, the cherub.\r\n\r\nLearn more at http://www.SaveTheCherubs.org",
