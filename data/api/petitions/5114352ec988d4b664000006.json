  "body": "Lane splitting (also known as lane sharing, lane filtering, or white lining) is a tactic many motorcycles use on a daily commute. This involves safely maneuvering the motorcycle in between cars. Every state with the exception of California bans this practice, I petition that this practice be allowed under these guidelines.\r\n1. The motorcyclist is not to exceed 10 MPH over what the surrounding vehicles are doing.\r\n2. The motorcyclist is not to exceed 40 MPH.\r\n3. Motorcycles over a certain width (Honda Goldwings, sidecars, Baggers, etc) shall not lane split.\r\n4. Motorcycles shall not lane split if there is not enough room between the two vehicles.",
