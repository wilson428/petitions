  "body": "Africa for Africans, Asia for Asians, White countries for EVERYONE?\r\nALL White countries and ONLY White countries are being flooded with third world non-whites, and Whites are forced by law to integrate with them so as to \"assimilate,\" i.e. intermarry and be blended out of existence.\r\nThat's genocide by U.N. definition:\r\n\"Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\"\r\nWe petition the President to end White Genocide in the United States, and to call for the end of White Genocide in Europe, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.\r\nSupporting White Genocide is not anti-racist. It's anti-white!\r\nAnti-racist is a code word for anti-white!\r\n------\r\nSupport White GeNOcide Project's Million Name March! (See petition #2)",
