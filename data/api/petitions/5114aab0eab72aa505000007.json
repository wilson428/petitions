  "body": "This brilliant animation, \"How Whites Took Over America\" http://goo.gl/IUenl, is an allegory of the GENOCIDE of WHITES that's being carried out today by MASSIVE immigration and FORCED assimilation.\r\nIn the spirit of We the People, we urge President Obama to emulate President Andrew Jackson and invite the public into the White House to join him for weekly screenings of this delightful 13-minute video!\r\nAnyone watching this video will agree that it contains NOTHING that is the least bit \"hateful\" or \"racist.\"\r\nAnd yet there are people who insist that this video not be shown.\r\nThey say they are anti-racist. What they are is ANTI-WHITE!\r\nAnti-racist is a CODE WORD for ANTI-WHITE!\r\n-----\r\nJoin White GeNOcide Project's Million Name March on Washington, D.C. to STOP WHITE GENOCIDE!
