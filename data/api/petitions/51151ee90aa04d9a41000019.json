  "body": "While Duke's student body is made up of many future leaders of our fine country, there is a small contingent that is waging a war against all that is good in our glorious land. The extremist faction of students known as the \"Cameron Crazies\" publicly organize in crowds topping 5,000 sometimes with the sole mission of verbal and mental harassment of student athletes. While tolerated, and sometimes even praised, in the past, the time has come to put an end to it. During last night's competition between the men's basketball team's of NC State and Duke, these extremists chanted \"How's your grandma\" to a grieving 18 year old while he competed during the second shot of a free throw visit: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=hZ9O2KOwjOk\r\n\r\nThis aggression will not stand, man",
