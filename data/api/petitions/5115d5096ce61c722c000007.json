  "body": "On 01/30/13, CMS Announced New Phase of Medical Equipment Bidding Program. Rates in Round 2 of DMEPOS Competitive Bidding are on average 45 % less than current fee schedule amounts and for mail-order diabetic supplies are on average 72 % less. \r\nThe current program is very harmful to small businesses and causing serious access issues for recipients.  The rates offered are very low and will force small providers out of business. \r\nThe current rates are based on a convoluted methodology which pits small providers in a life or death situation. \r\nAs provider of DME, we are asking for your support to replace the current DME Competitive Bidding program with the industry supported MPP (H.R. 6490) which is a more sustainable alternative. \r\n",
