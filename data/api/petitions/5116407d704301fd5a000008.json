  "body": "Flight Aviation Rules part 103 specifies the weight limit of ultralights to be 254 pounds.  This is based on the FAA mean weight of a 170 pound pilot.  This law caters to a demographic and is blatantly discriminate in that the safety margins only apply to small people.  Big & Tall people want to be able to build and fly these aerial vehicles as well.  I do not know of any other federal law that denies the American people a liberty based upon their physical stature.  Other countries have higher weight limits.  We are asking for either a change in law or personal waivers that allow us to build aerial vehicles in proportion to our weight based up on the 170lb pilot/254lb aerial vehicle ratio so that we can fly and fly safely without the financial burden of LSA or GA.",
