  "body": "The iconic original USS Enterprise model is a touchstone of modern American cultural history. This symbol of hope and exploration has inspired countless people, from children who became engineers and scientists, to Whoopi Goldberg and astronaut Mae Jemison. \r\n\r\nThe Enterprise was restored by the Smithsonian in 1991, but repainted with artistic license. It looks substantially different from its onscreen appearance. Though grateful to that restorer for his hard work, we now ask that this important artifact be restored as closely as possible to its original state; and that measures be taken to reverse and halt the effects of 50 years of gravity on the ship's structural integrity. We also ask that it be moved from a basement gift shop to a more prominent site, in the Museum of American History.",
