  "body": "Traditional values of Tibetan culture\u2014nonviolence, ethics, compassion\u2014universally benefit our human societies. It is not acceptable for an imperial power that rejects constructive dialogue to systematically dissolve Tibetan practices of livelihood, language, and religion without dynamic challenge by our government and news media, supported by global citizen dissent. 100 youth have burned themselves alive in protest; many more are unjustly imprisoned. The US must separate economics from horrific suffering and take a moral stand. End political cowardice! We the People do not condone China's cultural genocide in Tibet and declare that the PRC\u2019s own national treasures are of no value, nor worthy of world respect, unless it demonstrates a fair, humane policy toward the rights of Tibetan people.",
