  "body": "Veterans as far back as WW II are not having their claims managed in a timely manner, as all records are in paper files instead of being scanned and computerized.  The Aid and Attendance program is an example of one such area that needs immediate updating.  In addition, a case worker should be assigned to a claim once it is filed, so a filer has someone to talk to who is familiar with his/her case.  Speaking to someone who has no knowledge of the case each time a call is made just leads to frustration.  By January 1st, 2015 records for all Veterans should be accessible via the computer.  By January 1st, 2015  case workers should be assigned to all claimants. By January 1st 2014, additional monies must be allocated to the VA for these reforms. ",
