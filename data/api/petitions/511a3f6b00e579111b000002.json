  "body": "The IOC executive board has dropped wrestling from the Olympic program from the 2020 Olympic Games. FILA ( The international organization that governs wrestling) will have to apply for inclusion for the 2020 Olympic Games along other sports for one opening in the program.\r\n\r\nIf wrestling is not reinstated on the Olympic program for the 2020 Olympic Games then I ask that President Obama to pressure and ask the United States Olympic Committee to boycott the 2020 Olympic Games. If that does not happen then cut off all federal funding or tax breaks that USOC receives. \r\n\r\nThe United States has been one of the best countries and one the biggest participants in wrestling world wide. Its been a part of American culture since the Civil War. We need to fight to protect it!  ",
