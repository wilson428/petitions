  "body": "Help our voice reach the International Olympic Committee to show the support for reinstating wrestling into the Olympics.\r\n\r\nThe International Olympic Committee has decided to drop wrestling from the 2020 Olympic Games. However, this decision is not an absolute final decision. We still have time to let our voices be heard and display the true passion that we have as a wrestling community, both on and off the mat, in everything we do. We must put forth the same effort into getting wrestling reinstated into the Olympics as we do as an athlete in the practice room, a coach in the film room, or even a parent in the stands. \r\n\r\nWhile this decision is not final, the time to act is now. We must not sit back and wait. As a global wrestling community, we have the will-power to make our voices be heard.",
