  "body": "The installation of smart meters on private property is associated with a number of serious issues: \r\n \r\n- Government and industry reports reveal that our privacy is at risk because data are recorded that can reveal activities inside homes; \r\n\r\n- Experts report that inadequate cybersecurity measures may result in misuse or theft of data; \r\n\r\n- Scientists warn that radiofrequency radiation emitted from wireless meters may cause adverse biological effects and that current FCC limits are outdated.\r\n\r\nIt is urgently requested that the President provide direction through executive order or other means to emphasize the voluntary nature of smart meter installations (per Energy Policy Act of 2005) and to stipulate that no utility or government can install a smart meter on one's property without consent.",
