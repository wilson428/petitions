  "body": "In 1971, the Pakistani Army, in collaboration with a group of Islamist leaders, unleashed unbelievable horrors on an unarmed, civilian population killing 3 million people and raping more than 200,000 women. Today, as Bangladesh is finally seeking justice for these mass killings, religious extremist groups throughout the world are conspiring against Bangladesh. The government of Bangladesh has already received veiled threats from the President of Turkey, and \"The Muslim Brotherhood\" has issued a strongly-worded press release in support of these war criminals. We urge President Barack Obama and this administration to express solidarity with the millions of Bangladeshis who are spontaneously demanding justice and an end to communal politics.",
