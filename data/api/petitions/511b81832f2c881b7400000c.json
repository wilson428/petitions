  "body": "In his 2013 State of the Union address, President Obama said: \"We know our economy is stronger when our wives, mothers, and daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in the workplace and free from the fear of domestic violence.\" \r\n\r\nThis \"our wives, mothers, and daughters\" phrase is one he routinely employs, but it is counterproductive to the women's equality the President is ostensibly supporting.\r\n\r\nDefining women by their relationships to other people is reductive, misogynist, and alienating to women who do not define ourselves exclusively by our relationships to others. Further, by referring to \"our\" wives et al, the President appears to be talking to The Men of America about Their Women, rather than talking to men AND women.\r\n\r\nPlease embrace inclusive language, Mr. President.",
