  "body": "There is deep concern by the ongoing miscarriage of justice in the Anand jon Alexander case. This Indian citizen was clearly denied due process to a fair trial, and has been imprisoned under inhuman conditions since 2007. His Constitutional Right to a Fair and Impartial jury was denied , and Mr. Alexander was Prejudiced by LA  Police and there is clear evidence of Prosecutorial Misconduct.  The lead attorney's daughter who was clearly in charge of some of the crucial aspects of the defense including motions and investigations was exposed to have secretly( without knowledge or consent of Mr. Alexander),applied for and even become a paid deputy District Attorney for the same LADA's office ( i.e. the opposing party in this case) during the case.There is clear evidence of Juror misconduct .",
