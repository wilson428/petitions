  "body": "In 1914-22, the armed groups of Armenian Dashnak and Hunchak parties and the Armenian volunteers serving in the Russian, Greek and French armies carried out a systematic extermination of Turks, Azerbaijanis and Kurds in Anatolia and the Caucasus. 523.955 Muslim civilians were identified as victims, not including those missing or buried in mass graves. Western scholars estimated that overall up to 2.5 million Muslims perished in these massacres. Armenians loyal to the Ottoman state were also targeted by the Armenian nationalists.\r\nOn behalf of Turkic-Americans and the families of victims and survivors of these atrocities, we call upon President to recognize Soyk\u0131r\u0131m\u2013 the Muslim Genocide \u2013 alongside his annual April 24th Presidential Message commemorating the Armenian suffering in World War I",
