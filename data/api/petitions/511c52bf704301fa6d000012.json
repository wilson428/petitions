  "body": "CISPA is about information sharing. It creates broad legal exemptions that allow the government to share \"cyber threat intelligence\" with private companies, and companies to share \"cyber threat information\" with the government, for the purposes of enhancing cybersecurity. The problems arise from the definitions of these terms, especially when it comes to companies sharing data with the feds.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and share this petition so that we can protect the internet and our privacy.",
