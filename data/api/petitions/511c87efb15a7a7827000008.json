  "body": "Christopher Dorner, although an alleged criminal, was not given due process in the court of law which is guaranteed to all United States citizens under the U.S Constitution. The actions taken by the LAPD represent a clear detachment from what is right and morally acceptable. Functions that should be practiced consistently when it comes to U.S citizens regardless of the circumstance. We petition the Obama Administration to conduct a formal investigation of the recent events incited by the L.A Police Department in Southern California, and to use the fullest extent of Government resources to come to a clear and concise reasoning behind the shooting of innocent civilians, burning of private property, and the ultimate denial of basic constitutional rights to Christopher Dorner.",
