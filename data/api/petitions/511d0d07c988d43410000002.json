  "body": "We applaud President Obama\u2019s statement in the State of the Union address that the promise of an AIDS-free generation is within our reach. The U.S. has long been a leader in this fight, and we know that we can reach this goal both at home and globally if enough resources are made available. \r\n\r\nThe National HIV/AIDS Strategy and the Blueprint for an AIDS Free Generation are ambitious plans with goals and targets to end AIDS, but neither can have their intended impact without significant investment.  \r\n \r\nThe U.S. has the opportunity to change the trajectory of the AIDS epidemic. We urge the President to dedicate the resources necessary to fully support all evidence-based, lifesaving HIV/AIDS programs and end the AIDS epidemic once and for all \u2013 here in the United States and around the world. \r\n",
