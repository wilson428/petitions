  "body": "H4 visa holders come to USA as dependents of H1B visa holders. H1B visa holders play a important part for the economy of the country. They pay for taxes, health insurance, social security and follow all the rules and regulations. However their dependents are not allowed to work in the US so ultimately lot of them have to go back. When US can offer work permits to illegal immigrants then isnt it unfair to not allow H4 visa folders to work who are legally imigrated and follow all the rules and regulations ?",
