  "body": "Japanese Prime Minister Abe is scheduled to visit Washington late February. The outcome of his visit has potential to significantly impact not only the peace and stability of the Pacific region, but also the economic recovery of the U.S., and consequently, your presidential legacy in history.  The main objectives of Prime Minister Abe\u2019s visit are: First, to seek U.S. support on Japan\u2019s territorial dispute with China on Diaoyu Islands. And second, to solicit U.S. opinions on Abe\u2019s desire to revise or to reinterpret Article 9 of Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution. We strongly urge you to deny both attempts, because they are against the fundamental and long term interests of our country. The reasons are stated in a separate letter sent to President Obama.  ",
