  "body": "Dutch is a 4-year-old American Allaunt, who is a registered service dog and an important part of Jeremy Aguilar's life. According to the Aguilars, Dutch has never shown any aggressive behavior before or after the incident and is a certified AKC Canine Good Citizen. In November of 2012, Dutch was beaten and hit with a metal pole because he and another dog got into a fight. In self defense, Dutch bit the woman doing the beating on the leg and buttock. A judge in Montrose, Colorado has ordered Dutch to be euthanized- even though he has worked with trainers, veterinarians, and behavioral specialists both before and after the incident. They have all reported that Dutch is a well-mannered dog with a wonderful temperament. The professionals agree that Dutch bit in self-defense and was provoked.",
