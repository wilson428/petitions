  "body": "I am a U.S. citizen. My wife was illegally brought to the U.S. as a child. When we got married, I petitioned for her status to be adjusted. She became a U.S. permanent resident. She then applied for U.S. citizenship. Before we were married, my wife claimed to be a U.S. citizen in order to work and to prevent deportation. Because of our commitment to God, she freely admitted this on her citizenship application. Her application was denied, and she is now permanently barred from any immigration benefit and could be deported. \r\n\r\nThis bar on immigration affects millions of \u201cmixed status\u201d families like ours. Please keep families together by providing a path to U.S. citizenship for people like my wife, whose only crime is claiming to be a citizen of the country they love in order to survive.",
