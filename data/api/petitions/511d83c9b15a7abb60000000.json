  "body": "The President's FY2014 budget calls to completely eliminate all food aid programs from U.S. farmers used for over 60 years to assist the hungry of the world and extend national diplomacy.  Instead it will send U.S. taxpayer money direct to foreign governments.  This drastic change in foreign assistance will eliminate thousands of U.S. jobs and tax revenue in agriculture, transportation, and US based charities and in it's place provide tax dollars direct to foreign governments with ongoing histories of corruption.
