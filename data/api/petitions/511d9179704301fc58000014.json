  "body": "This petition seeks to end the creation of a medal intended to reward UAV pilots. The \"Distinguished Warfare Medal\" would outrank a Bronze Star with Valor Device, making the recipient more highly decorated than a combat veteran who had faced the enemy while under fire. Not only should this award rank no higher than an Army Achievement Medal, it shouldn't exist....period. Without taking any personal risk, these \"gamers\" deserve no awards, especially one which trumps a combat award.",
