  "body": "The breeding of captive cetaceans (whales & dolphins) is a form of animal cruelty and must be outlawed within the United States of America.\r\nThe breeding of cetacean's is a cruel practice for all animals involved. In captivity cetaceans are bred before they are physically and mentally mature enough to properly care for their offspring, resulting in many newborn death's and calf rejection's, uncommon among their wild cousins. \r\nCetacean's in the wild remain with their families for life, in captivity mother and calf are separated usually after 2 years. \r\nIn the wild a female cetacean gives birth every 3 to 10 years, and has her first calf at roughly 15 years of age. In captivity the female is bred as early as 7 year's old and give's birth every 2 to 5 years. \r\n\r\nEnd the breeding of cetaceans. ",
