  "body": "As citizens of the United States, we are urging you to ban animal-killing contests nationwide.  These contests have no relation to hunting and involve no fair chase.  Most often, these contests are promoted as fund raisers and \"bonding\" opportunities.  The point of contest hunts is to reward the person who kills the most animals with prizes, including assault weapons. \r\n\r\nOpponents claim that killing squirrels and other wildlife helps in pest control.  The killing of large numbers of animals disrupts the order of nature, especially mothers who have offspring lacking the appropriate survival skills.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, children\u2019s acts of animal abuse are some of the strongest and earliest diagnostic indicators of conduct disorder, often beginning as young as 6-1/2 years of age.",
