  "body": "Bangladesh is descending into anarchy under Sheikh Hasina, a cabinet of totalitarian view turning the country to one party rule by silencing the opposing views. Extra-judicial killings, abduction, murder of journalists/politicians are rampant. Regime set up \"International Crime Tribunal\" (Amnesty Int., HRW, Ambassador-at-large Stephen Rapp all expressed serious concern). Instead of trying the true perpetrators for 1971 war crimes, this biased court is being used to silence the top leaders of opposition parties. Regime is organizing massive rallies chanting \"Guillotine Justice\" utilizing government apparatus to pressure judge for the death penalty while opposition rallies are being crashed. Your urgent support against this unjust tribunal and towards restoration of democracy is solicited.",
