  "body": "I am a single mother of three children and a full-time graduate student (4.0 GPA) working towards a Masters in Public Administration with a focus on Latin American non-profit management at Appalachian State University, Boone, NC. My program requires an unpaid full-time internship to be completed. I have been offered such an internship at The Sarapiqu\u00ed Conservation Center in Costa Rica. This opportunity will be beneficial for both my own career, and for U.S. taxpayers by enabling me to obtain a job that will allow for my family to rise above poverty. However, NC Medicaid will not cover my daughters non-narcotic medication, which costs $1,222 per month, while we are abroad, even though I will still be enrolled at a NC University. Please ask Medicaid to cover a 6-month supply for my daughter.",
