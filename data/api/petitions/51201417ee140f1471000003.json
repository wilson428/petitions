  "body": "The so-called International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) was purportedly set up to try Bangladeshi collaborators in Pakistani war crimes from 1971. Several hundred thousand people died, and we feel that it is important that justice is meted out for those responsible. However, international organizations like the UN, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty say the tribunal is far from fair, and seems to have been set up to eliminate the current political opposition. Bangladesh is currently in the throes of protests for and against the ICT, and police are attacking and arresting hundreds of suspected opposition members, as the government cracks down on their activities. We urge President Obama and his administration to speak against this grave miscarriage of justice, and call for fair trials in Bangladesh.",
