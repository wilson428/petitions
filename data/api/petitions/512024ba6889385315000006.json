  "body": "During a tour of a Detroit Police storage facility, the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office discovered more than 11,000 untested rape kits dating back nearly twenty-five years. Each of those kits represents a woman, man or child who suffered a violent assault and underwent a lengthy and physically invasive evidentiary collection procedure in an effort to apprehend his or her assailant. Each rape kit has the potential to solve multiple crimes. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy is leading the effort to find the funding to get them processed. An estimated $15 million is needed to complete the project. ",
