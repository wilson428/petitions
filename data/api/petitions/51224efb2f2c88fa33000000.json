  "body": "In many states (including PA) emotional and psychological abuse and control are not considered in the same realm as physical abuse.  Many women and their children, stay in a severely unsafe home (e.g. death threats and use of weapons) to force them into specific roles or behaviors suitable to the abuser, due to the lack appropriate legislation protecting them, once they leave from their abuser.  However, lack of physical marks makes it nearly impossible to retain a legal Protection From Abuse, as these types of behaviors are not considered 'domestic violence'.  Please help us strongly encourage the Obama Administration - particularly with the help of Joe Biden - to include psychological, emotional abuse, and threats as a form of domestic violence.",
