Many of us are hardworking mother's,and father's and have children trying to make ends meet in a tough economy. Many of us are students, small business owners and beyond and we feel betrayed to have these delays prolong in excessive time frames, irregular status updates, notifications of errors when there are no viable or substantial reasons and the frustration with misinformation provided by tax preparing companies in an attempt to play the \"blame game\", blaming each other for the delay of processing our returns and getting our refunds.",
