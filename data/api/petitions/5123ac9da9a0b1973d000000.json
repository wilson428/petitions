  "body": "E2 Treaty Investor Visa holder\u2019s main wish is to be treated fairly within Comprehensive Immigration Reform.\r\n\r\nMany talk about a \u2018Line\u2019 for immigrants \u2013 for E2 Visa holders, there is no line.\r\n\r\nWith around 50,000 E2 businesses in the US, we employ an estimated 700,000 US citizens and turnover $45 billion a year \u2013 and pay taxes on this. E2 businesses would expand with a secure platform to work from. They are currently only able to plan so far ahead because of the restraints the renewal process puts onto them.\r\n\r\nThe E2 Visa does not cover children when they reach 21. They are also not covered by the proposed Dream Act as they are in the US legally!! All of the elements that are attributed to the \u2018Dreamers\u2019 apply to our children too.\r\n\r\nPlease check out www.E2VisaReform.org\r\n\r\n",
