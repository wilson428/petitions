  "body": "Evan Todd was wounded April 20th 1999 in the Columbine Massacre. He believes that the legislation the President is proposing to limit American's gun rights will fail. He is not the only person.\r\n\r\nEvan has penned an open letter to The President with one of the smartest, thorough explanations to date. The American people deserve to hear why The President disagrees. \r\n\r\nAmerican's deserve better than talking points with flawed logic.     \r\n\r\nhttp://bit.ly/XkWG1Q",
