  "body": "Let's put people back to work in the public sector and not just rely on the private sector to create jobs. The government can (and has in the past) created jobs and it needs to do so again. The idea that the government cannot create jobs is a giant lie. Let's hire more teachers, more firefighters, more public interest lawyers, and more postal workers. Let's spend more money on infrastructure and create more private sector construction, plumbing, electrician, and steamfitter jobs. If the government hired people, it would be good for the economy. It's simple economics, more people working means more people spending money on goods and services, more people paying taxes, and less people collecting unemployment and other forms of government assistance.",
