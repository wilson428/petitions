  "body": "The Financial Times article \"Death in Singapore\" (Feb. 15, 2013) sets forth shocking facts about the suspicious death of a young American, Shane Todd, PhD in Singapore on June 24, 2012.  Shane told his family his life was in jeopardy from foreign parties who had used his work on gallium nitride (GaN) amplifiers to compromise US national security and who might kill him to keep him from talking to US authorities. Shane was found hanged in his apartment the day he was to return to the U.S. The FBI has volunteered to assist the Singaporean police in investigating Shane's death and has been turned down. This petition asks President Obama to instruct the DOJ to investigate under 15 USC 1512(h) (the federal witness murder statute) whether Mr. Todd was killed to silence him about Chinese spying.",
