  "body": "Author and Iran-contra scandal Philip Marshall, his 17-year old son Alex, his 14-year old daughter Macaila, and their pet dog were shot to death on or about January 31, 2013 at their home in Murphys, CA. The Calaveras County Sheriff's Department prematurely contaminated the crime scene and ruled the deaths a murder-suicide by Mr. Marshall even though forensic evidence proves the deaths to be a triple homicide. \r\n\r\nMr. Marshall, a retired United Airlines pilot who once worked with DEA/CIA contract employee Barry Seal, himself gunned down in Baton Rouge, LA on Feb. 19, 1986, as well as Iran-contra scandal felon Oliver North, had good reason to fear for his life. The murders of the Marshalls calls for a full investigation by the Civil Rights Division of the US Department of Justice and the FBI.",
