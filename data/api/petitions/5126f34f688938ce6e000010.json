  "body": "The U.S. Border Patrol suffers from one of the highest attrition rates in law enforcement. \r\nSome of the most qualified agents choose to leave the Border Patrol to pursue alternative careers elsewhere. This is due to a multitude of reasons. One of which is the areas where they live and work. These areas are mainly located in rural border communities along the southwest border, with limited access to education, health care, and other amenities. \r\nThe nature of the job is grueling, with agents working long hours often in extreme conditions. The job itself is inherently dangerous, as highlighted by the fact of the number of agents killed in the line of duty. \r\nWe need the best qualified men and women protecting our nation's borders from terrorists, terrorist weapons, and narcotics smugglers.
