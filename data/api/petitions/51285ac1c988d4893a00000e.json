  "body": "Puerto Rico LGBTT citizens are treated as second class citizens by the government. We demand the Obama Administration to enforce the constitutional and human rights that we all have, as all men and women are created equal and should be treated the same way under the law.\r\n\r\nLGBTT constituents of PR are discriminated and not protected by laws against: domestic violence, discrimination and job termination due to sexual orientation. Same sex partners are banned from adopting  children. Transgenders are not allowed to change their name and sex on official documents. Hate crimes are a constant threat in the island.  \r\n\r\nLaw interpretations and decisions are being based on religious beliefs, violating the constitutional separation of Church and State. \r\n\r\nWe demand EQUALITY FOR ALL PUERTORICANS NO",
