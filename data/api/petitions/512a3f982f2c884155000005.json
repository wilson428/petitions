  "body": "This petition asks that Congressional salaries and benefits be withheld for non-performance of duties.  It was the duty of Congress to negotiate, in good faith, a reasonable compromise and pass legislation necessary to avoid punitive cuts in salaries, services and social programs, the sequester, that serve and protect the American people.  They have failed to do so, putting the very citizens they were elected to represent, and our nascent economic recovery, at risk. ",
