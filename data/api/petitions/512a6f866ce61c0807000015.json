  "body": "We respectfully request that President Obama  select NCUA leaders who understand the shared economic value for people and communities created by  the Cooperative model.\r\n \r\nAppointed NCUA governing leaders should hold to the same standards credit unions themselves follow.  They should be motivated by the unique contributions and needs of a Cooperative business.\r\n \r\nCredit Unions are Cooperatives built by members who fund them.  They are democratically organized and operated.  They adhere to the 7 Cooperative principles (http://bit.ly/7-coop).\r\n1.       Voluntary and Open Membership\r\n\r\n2.       Democratic Member Control\r\n\r\n3.       Member Economic Participation\r\n\r\n4.       Autonomy and Independence\r\n\r\n5.       Education, Training and Information\r\n\r\n6.       Cooperation Among cooperatives\r\n\r\n7.       Concern",
