  "body": "Several internet providers have unveiled their \"Six strike\" plan. The purpose is just as it seeks to fight copyright infringement and protect IP. The problem however is that to due so would require the providers to monitor data use and compile records of said use, infringing on privacy. On top of that if they believe you to be infringing they will begin throttling with no due process, unless you pay 35$ for an appeal, making it hard for you to connect to and search on the internet. The internet is increasingly becoming far more than a luxury every day. It is the fuel of our economy; enabling commerce, spurring innovation around the world, and spreading the ideals of the future. This plan will halt the flow of information and lock the poor out with no reprieve. The costs are not worth it.",
