  "body": "Mr. President Obama, Mr. Vice President Biden\r\nPlease invite Cuban dissident blogger Yoani Sanchez to the White House and the U.S. Senate to speak about the situation of Human Rights in Cuba. \r\nFrom her home in Havana, and supported by a network of friends who share her passion for the cause of a democratic Cuba, Sanchez has raised awareness about the lack of civil liberties and the disrespect for basic human rights under the Castro dictatorship for the past 53 years. \r\nFor the first time in many years, Sanchez has been allowed to travel outside Cuba, and she is scheduled to visit the United States. She has been active in speaking the truth about the realities of her country to anyone willing to listen. Please show your commitment to democracy and human rights by receiving her. \r\nThank You.
