  "body": "The Violence against Women Act of 1994 ensures that violence against women including domestic abuse, sexual assault, stalking, and other violence goes prosecuted.  From the beginning these protections were extended to all women including lesbian and transgender women.  Recently Republicans in the House stripped the bill of these protections, and lesbian and transgender women are no longer protected by VAWA.  This is a violation of human rights.  We must protect all women from violence.  This petition is to keep inclusion of lesbians and transgender women in VAWA.",
