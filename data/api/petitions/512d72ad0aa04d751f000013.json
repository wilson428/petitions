  "body": "We have spent the last two years promising Devine that we will bring her home soon. We have taken 4 trips to Nigeria. Devine has a orphan status. We have been clearly approved to adopt. My husband spent 7 weeks in Nigeria with her on his last trip, and obtained an adoption decree and passport. The US Consulate in Nigeria did their own investigation and will not tell us exactly what occurred during the investigation. All we know is that Devine was declined a visa. Red tape is preventing sweet Devine from coming home to us. She is heartbroken. Please help us bring her home. Take two minutes and sign the petition. She deserves a family. Every child deserves a family and Devine has one waiting for her. Thank you. Shayla Hood, Des Moines, Iowa. ",
