  "body": "Please support Reintroducing H.R. 4122, that will make it Illegal for private ownership of Wild Animals as Pets.  Prohibit the commercial trading or propagation of such species, not allow direct contact between the public and animals and not allow off-site public display of such species.\r\n\r\nWe believe this Bill stands a good chance of being passed.  And is needed in our nation, or we will continue to deal with the consequences of reckless animal owners without the commitment, expertise or resources to provide lifetime care for these animals. \r\n\r\nThis Bill is needed not only on the basis of animal welfare, but also of public safety. As shown in the incident in Zainesville Ohio in October 2011, when a suicidal big-cat owner released lions, tigers and other exotic animals. ",
