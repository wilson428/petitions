  "body": "The American visual effects industry is suffering right now. Many VFX facilities have been forced to move or have gone out of business because of underbidding exacerbated by government subsidies that drastically distort the price of VFX. For Example Last year, the province of British Columbia spent $437 Million to subsidize film production.  For every $100 paid to a BC VFX worker, the government pays $60 back to the studio. This is not a tax credit, it goes beyond the tax liability. No matter how successful or efficient our work is, we are ultimately at the mercy of the next government willing to distort prices and put the companies we work for out of business. We want to end the race to the bottom so we can compete on a level playing field and begin the race to the top.",
