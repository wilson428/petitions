  "body": "According to the American Cancer Society\u2019s report on Colorectal Cancer: \u201cColorectal cancer is often found after symptoms appear, [sic] and most people with early colon or rectal cancer have no symptoms of the disease. Symptoms usually only appear with more advanced cases. Regular screening can often find colorectal cancer early, when it is most likely to be curable. In many cases, screening can also prevent colorectal cancer altogether. This is because some polyps, or growths can be found and removed before they have the chance to turn into cancer.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe rates for colon cancer in people 50 & older have declined while the rates in people younger than 50 has risen. Survival rates decrease as the disease advances without detection.\r\n\r\nLower the screening age.\r\n\r\nIn Memory of Dave \u201cDiamond\u201d Cox\r\n\r\n",
