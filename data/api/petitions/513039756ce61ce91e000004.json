  "body": "We ask President Obama to urge the FDA to allow the majority of healthy gay and bisexual men to donate blood. Current blood donor policies are largely inconsistent, imposing significantly less restrictive deferrals to heterosexual men and women who engage in high-risk sexual behavior, yet banning gay and bisexual men who are HIV-negative, consistently practice safe sex, or are in monogamous relationships. The American Red Cross, American Association of Blood Banks, and America's Blood Centers all support reforming the current policy. Other countries have already reformed their policies to allow gay and bisexual donors. Thousands of desperately needed pints of blood are kept out of the depleted national blood supply each year as a result of this unjust exclusion. Reform is needed today!",
