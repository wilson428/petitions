  "body": "Chairman David Bullock of the 13th Congressional District Democratic Party of Michigan, concerned citizens, and the people of Michigan are fighting against Emergency Managers. Governor Rick Snyder's Administration has appointed emergency managers in cities and school districts across Michigan. These emergency managers have unilateral control over all aspects of government, deny voting rights, block collective bargaining rights and balance budgets by selling assets and cutting fire and police. We need the federal government to intervene and protect voting rights. Additionally, we need the government to promote job creation, spur growth of the local economy, focus on education and worker retraining programs, reform banking and health care institutions.",
