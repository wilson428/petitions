  "body": "Liberty and Ellis Island have remained closed since Hurricane Sandy struck the northeast in late October.  While there was significant damage, it's time for the federal government to get the ball rolling on reopening these two symbols of liberty and freedom.  Over 400 jobs and millions of dollars in revenue will be restored to NYC and New Jersey, two areas devastated by Sandy.  The government has done very little to reopen these Islands.  A huge boost to the local economy is just an opening away.",
