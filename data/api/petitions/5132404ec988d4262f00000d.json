  "body": "Support the boycott of 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi and invoke political and economic sanctions against illegitimate regime led by Putin. Russian citizens suffer from a wide spectrum of human rights violations inflicted by the \u201clawmakers\u201d installed thru fraudulent elections and Putin\u2019s police forces. Today Russia violates many international/UN treaties. Persecution on political grounds, activists imprisoning, censorship and mass media manipulations stripped Russian people\u2019s ability to participate in civil movement and political processes making it impossible to overthrow illegal regime via a national referendum. Therefore we think that the Olympic Games in Sochi will be viewed by the world community as a gesture of approval of the criminal and dangerous policy of the ruling elite in Russia.",
