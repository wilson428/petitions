  "body": "Legal documents in the United States only recognize \"male\" and \"female\" as genders, leaving anyone who does not identify as one of these two genders with no option. Australia and New Zealand both allow an X in place of an M or an F on passports for this purpose, and the UK recognizes 'Mx' (pronounced \"Mix\") as a gender-neutral title.\r\nThis petition asks the Obama administration to legally recognize genders outside of the male-female binary, and provide an option for these genders on all legal documents and records.",
