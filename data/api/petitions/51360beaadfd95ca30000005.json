  "body": "Daylight Savings Time is an archaic practice in our modern society. \r\n\r\nThe original reasons for the policies are no longer applicable, and the most cited reason for keeping DST (energy savings) has never been shown to be true.\r\n\r\nSome industries still like DST (like sporting equipment retailers), but there are many more who dislike the changed hours (like television).\r\n\r\nThe real issue, however is not the later hours or extra sunlight. Studies have shown that changing the clocks is responsible for health problems (including increased heart attack and vehicular accident risks) and leads to hundreds of thousands of hours of lost productivity in workplaces across the country. Also: It's really annoying.\r\n\r\nWe should either eliminate DST or make it the year-round standard time for the whole country.",
