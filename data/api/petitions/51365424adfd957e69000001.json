  "body": "Airport air traffic control towers provide services to pilots that are essential to the safety, the efficiency, and the smooth operations of flights. While not all airports have a control tower, airports with towers are typically very busy and have a significant amount of air traffic.\r\n\r\nAt these airports, the air traffic controllers regulate when aircraft can take off and land, and they contribute to aviation safety by helping to avoid collisions. Controllers also provide numerous other services to pilots.\r\n\r\nClosing air traffic control towers as a cost saving measure will be a detriment to aviation in this country. The closures will reduce efficiency and will adversely affect the safety of air travel.\r\n\r\nSee www.PremierFlightCT.com for additional details by the petitioner.",
