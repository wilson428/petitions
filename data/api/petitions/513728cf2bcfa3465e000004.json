  "body": "The \u201csequester\u201d has been used as an excuse to make cuts to services, benefits, and even salaries to those who deserve them the most.  \r\n\r\nOur real American heroes, those who swear to \u201cprotect and defend,\u201d are easy targets as their patriotic sensibilities preclude them from complaining when asked to sacrifice.\r\n\r\nHowever, it does not take courage, nor is it patriotic, to force others to sacrifice in your stead. When our country is asked to make sacrifices, real leaders lead by example.  \r\n\r\nWe propose that the President, and his nearly 300 White House staffers, cut their salaries to zero before cutting one dime from other hard-working Americans\u2019 benefits and salaries, especially our country\u2019s defenders, who they themselves have promised to serve, not be served by.
