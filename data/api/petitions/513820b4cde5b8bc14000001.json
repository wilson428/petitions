  "body": "The American people, in response to Senator Rand Paul's filibuster, demand a response to this question:\r\n\r\nDo you believe that it is constitutional for the President, the CIA, or any branch of the United States government to kill an American citizen that does not pose an immediate threat on U.S. soil -- using a drone or any other weapon?\r\n\r\nIf so, how does this not violate that American citizen's right to due process as provided to them under the Constitution?\r\n\r\nWe understand that you may or may not ever decide to kill an American citizen on U.S. soil. The question is, do you actually believe you have the authority to do this under the law?",
