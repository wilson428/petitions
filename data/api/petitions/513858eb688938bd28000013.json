  "body": "Apparently The Honorable Ray Mabus, the Secretary of the Navy, does not believe in equality as I do. According to ALNAV 014/13 Paragraph 3, Section E, his instructions are to:\r\n\r\n\"E.  CEASE NEW USMC ENROLLMENTS IN VOLUNTARY EDUCATION TUITION ASSISTANCE\r\n\r\nPer the instruction from the Secretary of the Navy, U.S. Marines will no longer be allowed to use their Tuition Assistance education benefits while on active duty. They are the only branch of the armed forces to be affected thus far. If Soldiers, Airmen, and Sailors are allowed to continue their education the Marines should have the same benefit.\"\r\n\r\nThe Department of the Navy should not treat Marines like second-class citizens. All service members are equal and they all deserve the same benefits.\r\n",
