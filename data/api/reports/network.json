In remembrance of the lives lost in this most recent tragedy we must band together to defend the right to bear arms more than ever. Understand that this occurred in an area which already has strict gun laws and also took place in a \"gun free zone.\" Now there is no way to predict how many lives could have been saved or if this could have been avoided altogether, but we will never know unless we take a step in the right direction of freedom and individual liberties. Let's empower the educators, not the criminals, because only criminals do not obey the laws and with this in mind there is no law that can change this fact. Liberty is safety, not laws, freedom and rights. So please, spread the message of liberty!",

The USPS is one of the largest union shops in the country.  If they can bust this up, they can wipe out much of the union support of the Democratic Party in future elections.  This is also, I believe the largest employer of veterans in the US.",

These areas are mainly located in rural border communities along the southwest border, with limited access to education, health care, and other amenities. \r\nThe nature of the job is grueling, with agents working long hours often in extreme conditions. The job itself is inherently dangerous, as highlighted by the fact of the number of agents killed in the line of duty. \r\nWe need the best qualified men and women protecting our nation's borders from terrorists, terrorist weapons, and narcotics smugglers.
